## Scene 1

### Scene Setting

- Expectation: Take control of airship.
- Chaos Factor: 5
- Alteration roll: Altered. Control room is inaccessible.

### Game
After reaching the armoury, Koldan finds [[Volk the One-Eyed]] stealing a magically compacted airship from the place. He opens it in the room, creating a hole in the ceiling and wall.
Koldan manages to run to the airship before it goes away. 
Is Volk alone? No
Has minions? Yes
Is he going to [[Allington Fortress]]? No

He gets on the ship unseen and it notices that the control room doors are blocked by some energy field when Volk enters them.

Other goblinoids? Yes, Hobgoblins
Already in combat with some knights.

I go down to search for a way to stop the energy field.
