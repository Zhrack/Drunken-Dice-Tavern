[[Koldan Greathammer]] is in the restroom when an explosion is heard in another place in the building. Screams start and Koldan goes out. He is wearing all his equipment since the celebration was partially in his honour. 

He exits the restroom and finds people running away. He hoes in the opposite direction.

He finds a room with torture tools for goblinoids. A gentle woman is there, seaching me for my axe, then goes away saying "Kill them all!".

In the main hall I find the main entrance busted open by a big explosion and 10 goblins, 1 goblin warrior and 1 dire wolf are fighting with 4 knights. I join the fight.
