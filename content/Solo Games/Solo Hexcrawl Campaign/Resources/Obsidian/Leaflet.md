Proof of concept currently. May not work as expected. Currently only tested on Windows & Mac.

## Working with the plugin & example

A map can be created with a `leaflet` code block. For example:

````markdown
```leaflet
image: https://i.imgur.com/jH8j3mJ.jpg
height: 500px
lat: 50
long: 50
height: 500px
minZoom: 1
maxZoom: 10
defaultZoom: 5
unit: meters
scale: 1
marker: <type>,<latitude>,<longitude>,<link>
```
````

## Options

## Map IDs

As of **3.0.0**, map ids are required. If a note with a old map block is opened, the plugin will warn you that the map now requires an ID.

Once an old map is given an ID, the plugin will try to associate the marker data with the new map.

The first time you open the plugin after updating to 3.0.0, a backup of your marker data will be created in case you need to downgrade. If you run into issues, please create an issue on Github.

## Image Maps

### Image Map URL / file path

Image maps can be loaded one of three ways:

1. Direct URL (e.g., https://i.imgur.com/jH8j3mJ.jpg)
2. Obsidian URL (e.g., obsidian://open?vault=VaultName&file=Path/To/Image.jpg)
3. Direct path to image (e.g., Path/To/Image.jpg)

### Multi-Image Maps

Images can be layered on top of each other by providing multiple images to the plugin:

````markdown
```leaflet
id: Map With Layered Images
image: Image1.jpg
image: Image2.jpg
image: Image3.jpg
```
````

This will generate a map with 3 layers. Image 1 will be on top, Image 2 in the middle, and Image 3 on bottom. The images will be aligned around their center points.

The control box in the top right of the map will allow you to change layers.

Markers can be created and saved on each layer separately from one another.

**If multiple images are provided, an ID _must_ be given to the map, or the map will only display the first provided image.**

### Latitude and Longtitude of Image Maps

Because an image map does not have a true coordinate system, the latitude and longitude provided must be given as a percentage from the **top left corner of the image**.

This setting may seem to not do anything without changing the default zoom level of the map.

### Unit and Scale

If provided, the plugin will scale the calculated distance between two points by `scale` and display the result as `xxx unit`.

## Markers

New markers can be added to the map by right clicking.

If any additional marker types have been created in the settings, a list will appear to choose from.

Once a marker has been created, it can be dragged to a different location.

Markers created on the map will be saved to the map instance. Marker data saved this way will persist as long as the map is associated with a note - if the map blocks are removed from notes, or if all of the notes containing map blocks are removed, **the data associated with it will be deleted after 7 days.**

### Marker Coordinates

<kbd>Alt</kbd>-clicking on a marker will reveal its coordinates.

### Marker Links

A marker can also point to a note; right-click on it, and a popup will appear. The target can be entered as the name of the note. Additionally, headers or blocks within a note can be the target of a marker:

`Note`

`Note#Header1`

If you have multiple notes with the same name, you should specify the direct path to the note. Otherwise, the map may not open the one you expect.

Once linked, a click will open the note (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-click to open in new window).

Additionally, markers can be created by dragging a note from the file tree and dropping it on the map.

Marker links can also be set to external websites. Clicking the marker will open the website.

#### Obsidian Commands as Links

Markers links can also be set to a defined Obsidian command from the command palette. This must be the full name of the command as it appears in the palette.

Setting a marker link to a command will execute the command when the marker is clicked.

### Markers Defined in the Code Block

Markers may be defined directly in the code block using the following syntax:

`marker: <type>,<latitude>,<longitude>,<link>`

An arbitrary number of markers can be defined, but _none of these markers will be editable._ If a change needs to be made to these markers, the code block must be edited.

The marker link may be defined as an Obsidian wikilink.

These markers **will not be included in exported marker data.**

### Marker Files, Marker Folders and Marker Tags

These parameters allow you to create markers directly from a list of markdown note files.

A note specified in this manner should have the following frontmatter tags:
`location: [lat, long]` **REQUIRED**
`mapmarker: <marker-type>` **OPTIONAL**

There is no limit to how many of these parameters you can have defined in the code block; all of the files found will be parsed for defined markers.

_Please note that until I can utilize some form of caching, having a large amount of marker files defined could impact performance._

#### Marker File

Marker files may be defined in the code block using the following syntax:

`markerFile: [[WikiLinkToFile]]` **OR**
`markerFile: Direct/Path/To/Note`

#### Marker Folders

Marker folders may be defined in the code block using the following syntax:

`markerFolder: Direct/Path/To/Folder`

This will search through _all_ of the notes in the specified folder, even in sub folders.

#### Marker Tags

If you have the [Dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) installed, markers may also be created from tags using the following syntax:

`markerTag: #<tag>, #<tag>, ...`

Each `markerTag` parameter will return notes that have _all_ of the tags defined in that paramter. If you are looking for files containing _any_ tag listed, use separate `markerTag` parameters.

If one or more `markerFolder` parameters are specified, the `markerTag` parameter will only look for notes _in the folders that contain the tags_.

#### Examples

```
markerFile: [[MarkerFile]]
```

would

1. Load the MarkerFile.md note file and, if it has the correct frontmatter fields, create a marker for it.

```
markerFile: [[MarkerFile]]
markerFolder: People and Locations
```

would

1. Load the MarkerFile.md note
2. Look through the People and Locations folder for additional notes

```
markerTag: "#"location, "#"friends
```

would

1. Find _all_ notes tagged with both `#location` **and** `#friends` and create markers using their frontmatter

```
markerFolder: People and Locations
markerFolder: Interests/Maps of the World
markerTags: "#"people, "#"friends
markerTags: "#"Paris
```

would search for notes that

1. Are in the folders People and Locations OR Interests/Maps of the World, AND
2. Contain both tags # people AND # friends OR the tag # Paris

### Marker CSV File

Marker data may be exportable to a CSV file. This data takes the following format:

| Column 1 | Column 2    | Column 3 | Column 4  | Column 5    | Column 6     | Column 7  |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Map ID   | Marker Type | Latitude | Longitude | Marker Link | Marker Layer | Marker ID |

Map ID is the _path to the note_ **plus** _"real" for real maps_ **OR** _the path to the image_ **OR** _the map id defined in the code block_. Example:

`Path/To/Note.md/Path/To/File.jpg` OR
`Path/To/Note.md/real` OR
`Path/To/Note.md/map-id-defined-in-code-block`

If left blank, Marker Type will default to "default".

Marker layer may be kept blank if a map only has 1 layer.

For new markers, Marker ID may be kept blank.

Marker data in this format can then be re-imported. This feature is still under development and may not work as expected.

## Distances

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-clicking the map, then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-clicking again, will display the distance between the two points.

Real-world map distances are displayed in meters.

Image maps can have an optional unit and scaling factor provided to display.

## Configuration

### Note Preview

Use Obsidian's note preview when hovering a linked marker.

**Please note, the Obsidian Page preview core plugin must be enabled to use this feature.**

### Latitude and Longitude

A real-world map will open to this default latitude and longitude if not provided.

### Base Marker

The base marker setting allows you to define a marker that other markers can be layered on top of. If no additional markers have been added, right clicking on the map will place this marker.

### Additional Markers

Additional marker types can be added, selectable from a context menu on the map.

#### Creating an additional marker

Adding a new marker displays a new window, where the new marker parameters can be added.

| Parameter   | Description                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marker Name | Displayed in the context menu when adding a marker (e.g., Location, Event, Person) |
| Marker Icon | Name of the Font Awesome icon to use                                               |
| Layer Icon  | Layer this icon on top of the base marker. If off, the icon itself will be used.   |
| Icon Color  | Override the default icon color                                                    |

If layer icon is on, the icon be moved around the base icon by clicking and dragging, to customize where the icon is layered. If <kbd>Shift</kbd> is held while moving the icon, it will snap to the midlines.

# Version History

## 3.0.0

### New Features

-   Map IDs are now required.
    -   A map that does not have an id will **not render**
    -   The plugin will try to load previously defined marker data once an id has been given to the map.
    -   This means marker definitions are no longer tied to maps - giving a map on a different note the same ID will load the same marker data
-   Marker data that is not associated with a file will now be deleted after 7 days to prevent data accumulation
-   Map data is now only saved if the map has defined markers
-   Image files can now be linked using an Obsidian wikilink (e.g., [[Image Name.jpg]])
-   New `markerFile` and `markerFolder` parameters in maps
    -   `markerFile` will read a note file's frontmatter and create a marker based on the `marker` and `location` tags
        -   `marker` should be a defined marker type (will default to `default` if not provided)
        -   `location` should be a array of [latitude, longitude]. **If not provided, the marker will not be created**
        -   The marker link target will be set to the file
    -   `markerFolder` will read _all_ of the files in the folder, and try to parse the frontmatter as above.
-   Made display of marker link in tooltip consistent with Obsidian's display style
-   Added data attributes to marker HTML element
    -   data-type: marker type
    -   data-link: marker link target, if any
    -   data-mutable: whether marker data can be edited
    -   data-type: marker type name (such as default)
-   Switched from uuid to 6 digit nanoid
-   Rendering improvements
