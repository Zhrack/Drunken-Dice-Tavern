* `Notes`:

Once arriving in the courtyard, Koldan notices that [[Volk the One-Eyed]] and a group of goblins are working around the activated portal, with a blue light coming from the center.
A small kobold slave with weights to the ankles is also working there, bullied by the goblins.

A group of 3 dwarves of the [[Royal Axes Dwarves]] is currently restrained near the portal, beaten up and with armor and weapons moved aside.
