# History
Long ago, the Tomb was built by the Scarlet Order, a religious order of the Scarlet God of Blood and Flowing Life.
Here the clerics of the Order were interred after a life of service.
After many years of usage, someone caused a terrible curse to be unleashed on the structure, causing an explosive growth of blood red vegetation. The red colour was given by the blood flowing in place of the chlorophyl.
