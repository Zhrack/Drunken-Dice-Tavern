TODO 
Roll for treasure, check FORGE what's available or Fantasy Companion or SG.
Also ask oracle if there is a passage to the other level. The bandits came from there.

- When exploring, use the standard room content table in Sandbox Generator, then use PUM/SUM/GUM to actually inspire content. This should avoid having all random rooms, instead following a bit the treasure/monster/empty/special format.
    - If it's still too generic, I could further specialize Special to be a type of challenge, based on Alexandrian Dungeon design.
    - Monster can lead to combat or social challenges.
    - Empty is lore and world building.
    - Treasure is treasure
    - Special can be all other challenges, to be rolled randomly on Alexandrian [[Design a Dungeon]]
