TODO 
- [ ] Roll for treasure, check FORGE what's available or Fantasy Companion or SG.
- [ ] Also ask oracle if there is a passage to the other level. The bandits came from there.
- [ ] Update PC sheets to use FC stuff. Cleric is missing powers. Also check in detail Arcana chapter for trappings, activations etc.
- [ ] Decide on how to handle Advances. I would like to handle it as Gold per XP approach. A certain amount of Gold to have an Advance?
    - [ ] Use this from FORGE

          SWADE PCs Ranks are legendary at 16+ advances though, at 10 they are veteran.
        - [ ] Simply split each level in half to have 20 levels instead. The growth is exponential, so continuing adding after is not doable.

    - [ ] Review Setting Rules in FC, there are some that are interesting.
    - [ ] Each expedition will require a round of Downtime after. News Feed of town is advanced at that time.

- [ ] When exploring, use the standard room content table in Sandbox Generator, then use PUM/SUM/GUM to actually inspire content. This should avoid having all random rooms, instead following a bit the treasure/monster/empty/special format.
    - [ ] If it's still too generic, I could further specialize Special to be a type of challenge, based on Alexandrian Dungeon design.
    - [ ] Monster can lead to combat or social challenges.
    - [ ] Empty is lore and world building.
    - [ ] Treasure is treasure
    - [ ] Special can be all other challenges, to be rolled randomly on Alexandrian [[Design a Dungeon]]
