Last session, we had our first fight with a group of adventurers, who were for some reason in a secret room made by the orcs.

I also did some clean up of some things I forgot in the PUM plot nodes, adding "Renegade Orcs" that we encountered at the beginning to the Meaningful Encounters list.
Also I added the "Passage to E1", that we are supposed to find somewhere on this level in F1, in the "Things to be found" list.
Time to also reset bennies! I think my sessions are a lot shorter than a group play, so I might need to houserule how they are given next time.
Now, back to our last adventurer.

> [!NOTE]
> Why the attack?
> What they were doing in the secret room?
> If they were in a secret room, did they come from E1 instead?
> Let's start!
> 
> Since we already know that we are going to do an interrogation, I think we can do a modified proposal, after a double encounter check due to the noise of the battle and the time it took.
> Encounter check, 2-in-8. 6. Nothing. Ticked time.
> Also, re-reading FORGE, I have been doing encounter checks every 10 minutes. I should do it every 2-3 ticks. I will do it every 3 ticks (30 minutes) to simplify things, plus after any noise.
> Here is the current time, first hour has just passed!
> ![[Pasted image 20240212232903.png]]
> 
> PUM proposal: Decrease intensity, tension, drama
> 
> SUM for NPC emulation:
> Stereotype: Love Interest: Would do anything to win them over
> Looks (Adjective): Environmental, meteorological, atmospheric, natural
> Attitude (unfavorable): Overreact to your presence, surprised, not expecting
> Contribution (unfavorable): Doesn’t contribute a lot; tries to be of help, though
> Outside impression (advantage for active and relevant NPC): Know what they’re talking about, educated, informed

> After surrendering, the elf adventurer looks quite surprised of being surrendered by this unlikey alliance between other adventurers and the wererats.
> "Please, I surrender, I surrender! Spare my life!" he says towards the general group, looking around in search of any positive signs from either the wererats or the adventurers.

> [!NOTE]
> Do the wererats engage in the interrogation? (likely) Yes, and hurry up. DD: No disruption

> The wererat that talked before engage in a violent interrogation, hitting the elf in the face and throwing away his sword.
> "You killed one of my men, tsk! Are you with the orcs??"

> [!NOTE]
> Is he with the orcs? Unlikely. Weak yes
> Since the elf will contribute, I think he will spill all the beans without too much fuss, he is alone after all now.
> Why were they guarding the place? To get revenge or have justice. Focus: Enigma/Query

> The elf quickly starts talking.
> "We were just doing a job! The orcs were paying us to keep guard in this room they recently uncovered! 
> We don't know much about the reason, but they were interested in finding a passage of some sort here. While they were searching a way to open the passage, we were mounting guard in case anyone was to find the hidden entrance that they were covering up against you all." And he points at the entrance were the wererats came from.
> "They haven't yet found what the passage, so maybe, if you manage, you can find some treasure here! I don't want anything to do with it anymore, just let me go."

> [!NOTE]
> Does the wererat leader keeps his calm? PUM: Yes, of course
> 

> After a moment, he grabs the elf by his long hairs and throws him away, then speaks to the others: "Accompany him to the exit, make sure he doesn't see any orcs on the way"
> 
> A couple of wererats follow his orders and escort him in a less than delicate way.
> Others move the fallen companion to the side.
> The leader, which is called Veth in several occasions by the other wererats, then says to Drukmor and Gultag: "For the help in battle, I thank you and will pay what is due."
> He then proceeds to give 100 gp to the duo.
> 
> After that, he says: "I ask now that you help us in finding this passage, it might open new prospects for our group, away from this place."
> 
> Drukmor: "I'll check with my companion here before committing to anything, but we appreciate the funds."
> After that, Drukmor and Gultag search the bodies on the ground for anything useful.

> [!NOTE]
> Is there any treasure? Yes
> Is it only coins? Yes
> DD: No disruption
> Let's use the FORGE treasure: Assuming 2d6x10 gp: 60 gp.
> A chunk of it is taken by the [[Wererats]] since they participated, so let's assume 30 gp for us.
> The rest of the equipment is some basic adventuring gear.
> Which tells us, they probably had lanterns or torches, which we are lacking now.
> Is there any fuel for lanterns? Unlikely. No
> So, it's torches. Say, 1d4 still new. 4! 2 to each of them.
> 

> "So, do we help them or we go out?" asks Drukmor.
> "We will probably return in this place often, since it's close to the town. Having friends might help."
> 
> The duo then agrees to help, starting the examination of the room.
> They also try to sell the orc plans to Veth.
> 

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Is he interested? SUM Opinion: Like the idea and approve, and will promote it.
> What is the value of them? I would say a treasure generation roll on FORGE.
> PUM quantifier: As expected 



TODO:
Drukmor will sell the orc plans. Roll a treasure roll.
Then play out searching for the room. Are the pillars related? Maybe some wooden inscription?
