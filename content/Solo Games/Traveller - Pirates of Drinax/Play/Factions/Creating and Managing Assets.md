# Asset Network
An Asset with AC 12+ can work for the PCs to create and improve relationships with other Assets, creating a network. Register that on [[Asset Networks]].

# One-off requests
Cost 1Dx1000 Cr x minimum AC required to carry out request.
This is done with coercion, persuasion or bribes, but final cost is the same. Asset might become unavailable to be friends afterwards, depending on narrative justification.
