Elements that you want to be possible in your Events. The more you know about the Situation the more Custom Elements you’ll likely place, although you don’t have to place any if the Category is mostly unknown to you.Custom Elements are likely to be placed throughout a List, with the most common in the 1-10 slots, less common in 11-15, and the most rare in slots 16-20.Place as many as you want, space allowing. Each Custom Element represents a specific thing, so the more you place the more you define this Category.EXPECTEDThis Element represents what you would expect to happen for this Category in an Event. You can fashion the expectation as you play, shaping it based on the adventure Context. The Expected Element is helpful as it allows you to fill out your List without having to come up with more Custom Elements.You might want to place some in the 1-10 slots, representing early Events being routine in nature. Having a few throughout the rest of the List can help balance the Category out.The Expected Element gives relevant detail to your Category without having to rely entirely on Custom Elements. Most Lists should probably have at least 4 Expected Elements in them.NONENot every Category needs to be represented in every Event. The more None Elements present in a List the more likely that Category won’t show up in an Event.Any part of the List where you think the Category would be less active.The less active a Category is the more None Elements it should have.SPECIALThis Element usually modifies another Element, shaking up the List a little.This Element is best situated in the middle or later portions of a List where it can modify Elements after you’ve had a chance to have some Events first.The Special Element should be rare, appearing at least once to add extra variety to a Category but no more than 3 times.RANDOMThis Element is a middle ground between Custom and Expected, allowing you to generate an interesting and unexpected Category Element as you play.Place it later in Lists with lots of Custom Elements to represent the unknown, and earlier in Lists that have few Custom Elements when you need Random Elements to generate specific results.The fewer Custom Elements you have the more Random Elements you may want to consider to add variety to your Category List.CONCLUSIONOnly include this Element if the Situation has an end.This goes in the first Category List near its end. The further down the List you place it the longer the Situation is likely to last.You only need this Element once. However, you can repeat it if you want to shorten the duration of a Situation"},"Crafter-Series/Event-Crafter/Event-Crafter-Elements-Reference":{"title":"Event Crafter Elements Reference","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Event Crafter Elements Reference §\nTODO.

Some have been found, others are still lost but all have resisted all efforts to open them. Sometimes someone finds a key or a cave-in uncovers a way inside. In the rare cases Seekers entered and left those laboratories alive, great riches, pre-Curse magical objects, knowledge and new horrors were added to the Kingdom.\nUnsealing a laboratory §\nFinding a way inside a laboratory should involve an investigation into the key or magic word needed to unlock the giant circular metal doors that lock them.\nMaybe a clue can be found on the carvings of the door. Maybe an ancient deposit has the key, but it’s under the control of another faction. In any case, the effort to unseal a laboratory can lead to an adventure in itself!\nEvent Crafter Lists §\nSituation: Exploring a Magical Laboratory §\nWhen entering inside a Laboratory, this Event Crafter list can be used as inspiration and basis to be personalized.\nWhen a Laboratory is encountered for the first time, you can roll on the Action Meaning Table 2e and Descriptions Meaning Table 2e, Locations, Curses, Dungeon Traps, Dungeon Descriptors, Mutation Descriptors or Powers Meaning Tables, based on the Context.\nEach Laboratory was focused on a particular area of magical or alchemical study and that should be chosen upon entering it for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocationsEncountersObjectsPP000TypeRandomizedRandomizedRandomized1Lab FeatureSeekersAnomalies2WildlifeHistory clue3Mutated InhabitantsLab Feature4Mutated WildlifeResiduum5Experiment ResultExperiment Result67891011121314151617181920\nLocations §\nLab Feature §\nThis result means that the location found is linked to the main function of the lab.

If inspiration is needed, rolling twice on the Descriptions Meaning Table 2e, Legends, Mutation Descriptors, Objects, Creature Descriptors or Characters will provide some words regarding characters, creatures, objects or situations about them.\nLab Feature §\nMost laboratories were focused on studying some specific aspect of magical energies or creatures. This led to each of them having some peculiar structure or device, be it unique or defining the entireity of the structure. Maybe the entire laboratory is built with magical energy channels going thorugh it, or maybe a big containment structure defines a place to keep large or dangerous creatures. This Object can be large enough to define the entireity of the location, become some kind of “location” in itself. If possible, this result should be merged with the Location result, but if it doesn’t make sense, give more importance to this result to better accentuate this laboratory’s unique features."},"Cursed-Kingdom/Concepts/Wild-Magic-Emission":{"title":"Wild Magic Emission","links":["Cursed-Kingdom/Locations/The-Spire","Cursed-Kingdom/Locations/Cursed-Kingdom","Cursed-Kingdom/Concepts/Residuum","Cursed-Kingdom/Concepts/Wild-Magic-Field"],"tags":[],"content":"These terrible and magical events are started roughly every 1-2 days from the The Spire.\nAt the beginning, a strong thunder is heard in the sky, announcing the arrival of a new Emisison.

Depending on your choices though, you can easily personalize the tone towards high fantasy, OSR-style loot delving or some other fantasy subgenre. It mainly depends on which elements you will choose to focus your story.\nWhat you need §\nThis setting is mainly designed for use in solo or co-op roleplay, specifically by using Mythic Game Master Emulator Second Edition while playing it on the fly, with zero preparation (a part reading this document). This setting can be used with any other oracle or system, but some tables are specifically made to be used with Mythic and assumes its use. With other system some adjustments might be necessary.\nI also recommend and assume the use of other resources by Word Mill Games, specifically the Event Crafter, introduced in Mythic Magazine #24. This can be replaced also by the Randomized Location Crafter (Mythic Magazine #2) or the original Location Crafter. This last one will require some modifications to the lists to add Expected, Special and other standard Elements that are randomized in the other two versions.\nThis resource is not strictly necessary though, since all locations will contain enough descriptions to play without them, maybe using some meaning tables or oracle question from your favourite system.\nAnother one are the Keyed Scenes from Mythic Magazine #10.\nSpoilers? Don’t worry about them §\nBefore playing, I recommend reading through all the setting, to better understand what is present and the mood of it. Since the adventures will be generated while playing, there is no risk of spoilers. For example, you might know about the existence of the Cult of the Curse faction, but their presence in your story is not even a guarantee!\nAttribution §\nThis work makes use of Mythic Game Master Emulator, Event Crafter, Keyed Scenes and Randomized Location Crafter, all by Tana Pigeon, published by Word Mill Games, and licensed for our use under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.

Most expert Seekers avoid it, preferring doing a longer round around it to reach the White Hell.\nThe main feature of this Field is the subtle mind alterations that act on all that comes inside, modifying or erasing their memory of the road walked inside of it, making it impossible not getting lost and possibly dying of hunger in this dead and pallid area.\nWith time everyone and everything dies among the trees and a lost wanderer will often find corpses of their predecessors in varying states of decomposition.\nThe Anomalies that are created by this Field are usually what causes these mind effects, completely invisible to the eye but emitting a faint smell of rotting corpses when getting closer.\nA way to survive is known to only a few selected by the Bandit King himself.\nThe rare Residuum produced by these Anomalies are the only objects capable of shielding the wearer from their effects. It’s rareness is also accentuated by the active effort of the Bandits in finding and hoarding them in their hideout, so that the Bandit King is able to control access to only the most trusted collaborators to his hideout.\nThe Hideout §\nThe Hideout is the secret residency of the Bandit King and the center of coordination for Bandits’s attacks.\nOriginally was an old hunting lodge in the forest, which was expanded to become a big complex of mostly wooden buildings with a walled perimeter. Here can be found barracks, dormitories, kitchens and storage buildings for stolen Residuum and other objects found in the Kingdom.\nWith regular cadence a convoy departs towards the Outside World to sell the goods on black markets, kept hidden from prying eyes by some Residuum objects that hide their traces.\nNo faction has still found how the Bandits have contact with the Outside World.\nTo keep all these secrets, the Bandit King keep the Hideout location known only to the necessary people, seeking and killing everyone that betrays him and everyone known to be in contact with the traitor."},"Cursed-Kingdom/Locations/The-Spire":{"title":"The Spire","links":["Cursed-Kingdom/Concepts/Curse","Cursed-Kingdom/Locations/White-Hell","Cursed-Kingdom/Concepts/Wild-Magic-Emission","Cursed-Kingdom/Locations/Cursed-Kingdom","Cursed-Kingdom/Factions/Seekers"],"tags":[],"content":"Many historians think that The Spire is where the Curse originated.\nIt’s located near the borders of the White Hell, but still outside the limits of the old capital city.\nThis ominous structure is the place from which Emissions originates, but no one seems to be able to reach it alive.

Flourishing and at the center of a sprawling empire, a few millions of inhabitants called it their home.\nThe Curse §\nDecades ago, a cataclysmic event destroyed the entire civilization of this Empire. Today the exact nature of it is still debated, but the magical destruction and the instabilities in the magical foundations of the region give strong suspects of some arcane mishap, originated in The Spire.\nSince that day, the region today known as Cursed Kingdom, is an abandoned place, where living beasts are mutated by the influence of wild magic, the very rules of the world are thrown away by Wild Magic Fields and their Anomalies.\nCrazy or courageos adventurers try to retrieve Residuum from those areas, while other groups war over the destiny of this mysterious and deadly place.\nThe White Hell is the most dangerous of these Wild Magic Field, where your very soul is in danger of forever wandering those cold wastes.\nTravelling the White Hell §\nTravelling in this Wild Magic Field is considered to be the most dangerous journey that one can make. Maybe only barring The Spire, from which no one returns whole. Only expert Seekers adventure in the White Hell, with detailed equipment and an iron will.\nAfter the Curse, the entire capital city became a land of eternal snow and winter, where countless perished and their souls still linger there, forever in search of other souls to take from imprudent travelers. Due to these tormented souls, surviving this city requires a good supply of Light Crystals, from which their energy keeps the souls away for their limited duration. Running out of crystals means a slow but sure death from the immaterials ghosts, who grasp at the living soul and suck their energy away,\nIt’s impossible to fight them, be it with steel or magic.\nIn case the Player Character find itself without the protection of a Light Crystal, each hour its life energy should decrease gradually. This can be simulated with you chosen RPG system by lowering the maximum life resource pool of the character, or can be covered by Fate Questions too. Some kind of resistance check could be implemented also if wanted. A Character should survive a maximum of a day without a Crystal, requiring at least a full night rest for its own soul to recuperate from the encounter with these tormented souls.\nThe city itself is always covered in snow, with freezing temperatures and dead bodies of unfortunate travellers often lingering the main routes of exploration.\nSome Mutated Wildlife and Mutated Inhabitants live here as well, with a weird ecosystem only disturbed by intruders in search of the rare type of Residuum found here.\nEvent Crafter Lists §\nSituation: Journeying the White Hell §\nAll locations are generally not inhabited permanently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocationsEncountersObjectsPP000TypeRandomizedRandomizedRandomized1Noble districtSeekersAnomalies2Artisanal districtBanditsEdibles3Market districtWildlifeField Feature4Industrial districtCult of the CurseLight Crystal5SlumsMutated WildlifeDead bodies6Frozen DocksMutated InhabitantsResiduum7The UniversityWardens of the Kingdom8Roll Twice, or None91011121314151617181920\nLocations §\nAll locations refer to neighborhoods of the White Hell.

Can be a treasure, can be a trap, can be info. Both positive and negative. Are always found once some action for it is taken.\nA secret can be the result of a puzzle or other risky encounter, whose presence can be discovered as landmark or hidden. With secrets there is a chance of failing when trying.\nOverview:\n\nLandmark: things you find in the hex or in the room.\nHidden: Something is there that is covered, inside, behind etc. A chest, a curtain covering a wall. Will you spend time investigating (automatic success, cost is usually time) and the risk in uncovering what is there? (can be a trap or treasure…)\nSecret: Locked behind a test. It’s Hidden + can fail and remain locked. Should have bigger rewards, sometimes even both positive/negative.\nThe presence of a secret can be a landmark or hidden. A library aligned in the wall, with rotation marks on the ground. How to find and understand the opening mechanism though?\n\n\nComponent-based monsters §\nhttps://mindstorm.blot.im/nested-monster-hit-dice\nMonsters with nested components that give abilities and can be individually targeted. OSR focus, but should work in 5e.\nIt can work with landmark/hidden components above. Landmark are explained on first encounter.\nOverview:\n\nBuild complex monsters by splitting their HD and nesting it as components. The more complex your nesting the harder the monster is to defeat. Going five layers deep implies a powerful “boss” monster that will prove a challenge.\nReveal all components except hidden ones when describing the monster. Make sure the players understand the components. You may need to repeat this throughout the fight as a summary of the situation.\nWhen players attack, always ask them how and what they attack. This is why it’s important that you’ve revealed the components. They need to choose a method and a target of attacking.\nIf the monster can be defeated without all components being destroyed, tie certain ones to a “Lifeblood” tag. Destroying all Lifeblood components kills the monster.\nTie abilities and attacks to the components. All attacks and abilities should be tied up to hit dice in some way. Everything than becomes negatable by PC actions and you’ll have a better grasp when making a ruling about ad-hoc actions.\nPlayers automatically fail when they attack a component without dealing with the upper layer. When this happens, spell out very clearly why their attack failed. This may involve revealing hidden components.\nCritical hits either deal double damage or the player can opt to redirect to any known component. This bypasses the rule about upper level components acting as a shield. If the component is protected by a hidden layer that the players haven’t discovered, inform them about the hidden component and then tell them they must choose a different target.\n\n\n\nThe Antenna blocks access to child nodes. Need to make noise/cut them or some other solution to block them.\nThe carapace is uncovered after the first attack on the main body, even if the heart is visible under it’s semi transparent layer.\n\n\n\nStealth Turn (or Better Stealth gameplay) §\nhttps://www.mindstormpress.com/stealth-turns\nOverview §\n\nInteresting even if it assumes Turn based exploration, like ICRPG.\nWithout turns, the table can be useful, together with rule of Rolling Stealth only if actually needed.\n\nGameflow: Without turns, after everyone has said what they do, you roll on the Stealth Event Die to check any events.\n\nThe stealth Event Die can be rolled in case of prepping or improvising game:\n\nIn depth on each entry:\n\nBonus inspiration tables §\n\n"},"D&D-Campaign/Lazy-DM":{"title":"Lazy DM","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nIn a given encounter, choose the monsters that make sense in the current story, location, and situation.\nDetermine if the encounter may be deadly.

They will point to the Githyanki or Githzerai in the Astral Plane. They will need to find a way to travel there and meet them.\nThis adventure will entice surviving in the plane while travelling there, so small exploration encounters and some combat.\nPart 2 §\nOnce there, they will be asked to help in a raid to the Mind Flayers, where Draendian will recognize the chief as the old chief that led the attack. Adventure will be a map of attack to the group, where there will be traps too.\nBackground §\nDreandian was an orphan and he was always bullied for being a half-elf - the only half-elf in fact in the small town. He lost part of his ear at a young age, while defending his best friend from bandits, which was a halfing named Zalner. Thankfully that was all he lost, for the time being.\nHe always had a passion for music which he picked up from the village’s archpriestess, Mentee; the closest thing he and Zalner had for a mother.\nUnfortunately, at the time war was raging in that region of the world. And while Dreandian and Zalner were exploring one day in the nearby forest, a skirmishing army raided the town leaving none alive.\nHe and Zalner, not having anywhere to go and wanting to avenge the destruction of the temple, decided to enlist to fight back.\nAfter a year in training they finally got their chance to avenge Mentee’s death, but at a terrible cost. Zalner did not make it and died on the battlefield in Dreandian’s arms. Dreandian considered himself responsible and never forgave himself for it.\nAfter that fateful battle the war ended and not having a home or a friend, Dreandian wandered the world. Finding solice in his music he kept the memory of Zalner and Mentee alive. Tapping into his pain he was able to unlock certain abilities that allowed him to weave magic. As he realised what he was able to do he tried exploring his abilities and educating himself wherever he could, be it temples or libraries and however he could, be it legally or illegally. Leading the life of a rogue, he avoided staying in one place for too long, considering he’d try to scam rich folk for extra coin. But when the need arised, he would also defend any innocents in need, always keeping in mind the closest thing he ever had to a family.\nDreandian has a soft spot for non-humans, especially youngling orphans. On the other hand, he always keeps a distance from humans, due to his past. He always has an amiable look, decorated with a witty smile. But he’s too eager to pick a fight, always finding an excuse to taunt or provoke anybody that “has it coming”. Choosing to have his hair short and facial hair unshaved, he enjoys displaying his half-elf origin as a way of rebellion against non approving humans.\nSurvey §\nWhat are some NPCs important to your character?

They  can call upon The Nameless to ask this, he will gadly help.\nPart 2: The Cult of Dispater collecting gold and ruby to summon §\nBackground: §\nMy name is Madrick, Goliath born of the Inulanat tribe to the far south. Mine was a small nomadic tribe, a poor one. We survived by dodging larger warbands, and by living on their scraps. Any animal herd we encountered had already been thinned out by others, and rarely were we first to forage an area for fruits and grains. What little we did find was shared between all in the tribe, first by need, then the surplus by merit. \nI rarely got any surplus. As a young adult I was a bad forager, a bad hunter, a bad tracker, and a middling warrior at best. The few useful skills I did have like my strength and my skill with a mace might have been of use in a larger tribe that could fairly compete for resources with the others, but we were too few to even envisage that. \nThe result was simple. I was a burden on the tribe. I had to rip roots out of the ground to gnaw on them all day and get a few extra calories. I earned my middle name because of this practice. I was soon known as “Rootmuncher”. \nA few days after my twentieth birthday, the decision was communaly taken to exile me from the Inulanat tribe. There was no anger in that decision, no animosity. Only deep melancholy, as I had to leave my friends and my family, expected to die in the cold.\nMy father, Miran “Treebreaker” was the leader of the tribe, so he himself burned the emblem of the tribe off of my tunic, leaving the hole that is still there to this day. He had watery eyes and a grim expression as he watched me walk away in the snow. \nI survived only through luck (finding a network of caves with mushrooms to eat in my second week of exile) and sheer determination. I knew I could come back to my tribe one day with honour if I expanded my skills and became a true survivalist, and so I would not let myself die without a fight. \nI also knew of other Goliaths from a few friendly tribes that got exiled in earlier years and might still be alive. I want to live to find them, to bond and compete with them. A good childhood friend, Anela “Thintree” Kulaga is one of those exiles. She was a sickly and weak member of another small tribe that was slowly developing druidic powers in her teenage years before being exiled. I want to figure out if she survived, and if she improved her knowledge of nature. \nOnce out of the mountains I travelled north, doing my best to survive. It became easier once I came closer to civilization and started doing odd jobs for food and shelter. I helped farmers with their harvests, I ripped roots out of the ground so buildings could be erected, I was the bodyguard of a Gnome merchant for more than a month. His name was Sinlen Dublis, and he taught me how to stitch my shirt back together. He might also be a source to buy goggles of light from, since he sells various baubles. \nNPCs:  §\nMiran “Treebreaker” Inulanat: Father. Strong Goliath Barbarian. Charismatic tribe leader. Survival of the fittest and survival of the tribe as a unit are the most important things in his leadership style. We share a loving bond, but he valued the survival of the tribe over my own. I want to prove myself to him. \nAnela “Thintree” Kulaga: Good childhood friend. A Goliath Druid. Sickly and weak of body, but smart and filled with love for nature. Felt suffocated by the competitiveness of Goliath society, as she does not care for comparing herself with others. \nSinlen Dublis: Male gnome traveling merchant. Taught me the basics of living in civilization. Outwardly friendly to strangers, for good client relations, but reserved and shy when not working. \nFlaws:  §\nI care little for possessions that do not have an obvious and near immediate use. I will throw a pouch of gold away before a solid rope. Does not apply to objects of sentimental value. \nMy competitive side is mostly turned inwardly. I will seek increasing challenges, and will be unhappy if not improving. Am more likely to put myself in danger because of this. \nDescription: 7 and ½ feet tall. Bald. Light grey skin with symmetrical black markings. \nLight brown tunic, with a large burn mark over the heart. Pants of a darker brown \nMy Objective:\nI would like the possibility of interacting with a few Goliaths once in a while, just as NPCs. My character is pretty conflicted when thinking of his place in Goliath society, and talking with others would be interesting for development.\nI will want to earn a new nickname for my character after a while, since he earned his current name through shame.

Otherwise, the map may not open the one you expect.\nOnce linked, a click will open the note (Ctrl/Cmd-click to open in new window).\nAdditionally, markers can be created by dragging a note from the file tree and dropping it on the map.\nMarker links can also be set to external websites. Clicking the marker will open the website.\nObsidian Commands as Links §\nMarkers links can also be set to a defined Obsidian command from the command palette. This must be the full name of the command as it appears in the palette.\nSetting a marker link to a command will execute the command when the marker is clicked.\nMarkers Defined in the Code Block §\nMarkers may be defined directly in the code block using the following syntax:\nmarker: &lt;type&gt;,&lt;latitude&gt;,&lt;longitude&gt;,&lt;link&gt;\nAn arbitrary number of markers can be defined, but none of these markers will be editable. If a change needs to be made to these markers, the code block must be edited.\nThe marker link may be defined as an Obsidian wikilink.\nThese markers will not be included in exported marker data.\nMarker Files, Marker Folders and Marker Tags §\nThese parameters allow you to create markers directly from a list of markdown note files.\nA note specified in this manner should have the following frontmatter tags:\nlocation: [lat, long] REQUIRED\nmapmarker: &lt;marker-type&gt; OPTIONAL\nThere is no limit to how many of these parameters you can have defined in the code block; all of the files found will be parsed for defined markers.\nPlease note that until I can utilize some form of caching, having a large amount of marker files defined could impact performance.\nMarker File §\nMarker files may be defined in the code block using the following syntax:\nmarkerFile: [[WikiLinkToFile]] OR\nmarkerFile: Direct/Path/To/Note\nMarker Folders §\nMarker folders may be defined in the code block using the following syntax:\nmarkerFolder: Direct/Path/To/Folder\nThis will search through all of the notes in the specified folder, even in sub folders.\nMarker Tags §\nIf you have the Dataview plugin installed, markers may also be created from tags using the following syntax:\nmarkerTag: #&lt;tag&gt;, #&lt;tag&gt;, ...\nEach markerTag parameter will return notes that have all of the tags defined in that paramter. If you are looking for files containing any tag listed, use separate markerTag parameters.\nIf one or more markerFolder parameters are specified, the markerTag parameter will only look for notes in the folders that contain the tags.\nExamples §\nmarkerFile: [[MarkerFile]]\n\nwould\n\nLoad the MarkerFile.md note file and, if it has the correct frontmatter fields, create a marker for it.\n\nmarkerFile: [[MarkerFile]]\nmarkerFolder: People and Locations\n\nwould\n\nLoad the MarkerFile.md note\nLook through the People and Locations folder for additional notes\n\nmarkerTag: &quot;#&quot;location, &quot;#&quot;friends\n\nwould\n\nFind all notes tagged with both #location and #friends and create markers using their frontmatter\n\nmarkerFolder: People and Locations\nmarkerFolder: Interests/Maps of the World\nmarkerTags: &quot;#&quot;people, &quot;#&quot;friends\nmarkerTags: &quot;#&quot;Paris\n\nwould search for notes that\n\nAre in the folders People and Locations OR Interests/Maps of the World, AND\nContain both tags # people AND # friends OR the tag # Paris\n\nMarker CSV File §\nMarker data may be exportable to a CSV file. This data takes the following format:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1Column 2Column 3Column 4Column 5Column 6Column 7Map IDMarker TypeLatitudeLongitudeMarker LinkMarker LayerMarker ID\nMap ID is the path to the note plus “real” for real maps OR the path to the image OR the map id defined in the code block. Example:\nPath/To/Note.md/Path/To/File.jpg OR\nPath/To/Note.md/real OR\nPath/To/Note.md/map-id-defined-in-code-block\nIf left blank, Marker Type will default to “default”.\nMarker layer may be kept blank if a map only has 1 layer.\nFor new markers, Marker ID may be kept blank.\nMarker data in this format can then be re-imported. This feature is still under development and may not work as expected.\nDistances §\nCtrl/Cmd-clicking the map, then Ctrl/Cmd-clicking again, will display the distance between the two points.\nReal-world map distances are displayed in meters.\nImage maps can have an optional unit and scaling factor provided to display.\nConfiguration §\nNote Preview §\nUse Obsidian’s note preview when hovering a linked marker.\nPlease note, the Obsidian Page preview core plugin must be enabled to use this feature.\nLatitude and Longitude §\nA real-world map will open to this default latitude and longitude if not provided.\nBase Marker §\nThe base marker setting allows you to define a marker that other markers can be layered on top of. If no additional markers have been added, right clicking on the map will place this marker.\nAdditional Markers §\nAdditional marker types can be added, selectable from a context menu on the map.\nCreating an additional marker §\nAdding a new marker displays a new window, where the new marker parameters can be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameterDescriptionMarker NameDisplayed in the context menu when adding a marker (e.g., Location, Event, Person)Marker IconName of the Font Awesome icon to useLayer IconLayer this icon on top of the base marker. If off, the icon itself will be used.Icon ColorOverride the default icon color\nIf layer icon is on, the icon be moved around the base icon by clicking and dragging, to customize where the icon is layered. If Shift is held while moving the icon, it will snap to the midlines.\nVersion History §\n3.0.0 §\nNew Features §\n\nMap IDs are now required.\n\nA map that does not have an id will not render\nThe plugin will try to load previously defined marker data once an id has been given to the map.\nThis means marker definitions are no longer tied to maps - giving a map on a different note the same ID will load the same marker data\n\n\nMarker data that is not associated with a file will now be deleted after 7 days to prevent data accumulation\nMap data is now only saved if the map has defined markers\nImage files can now be linked using an Obsidian wikilink (e.g., Image Name.jpg)\nNew markerFile and markerFolder parameters in maps\n\nmarkerFile will read a note file’s frontmatter and create a marker based on the marker and location tags\n\nmarker should be a defined marker type (will default to default if not provided)\nlocation should be a array of [latitude, longitude]. If not provided, the marker will not be created\nThe marker link target will be set to the file\n\n\nmarkerFolder will read all of the files in the folder, and try to parse the frontmatter as above.\n\n\nMade display of marker link in tooltip consistent with Obsidian’s display style\nAdded data attributes to marker HTML element\n\ndata-type: marker type\ndata-link: marker link target, if any\ndata-mutable: whether marker data can be edited\ndata-type: marker type name (such as default)\n\n\nSwitched from uuid to 6 digit nanoid\nRendering improvements\n\nBug Fixes §\n\nFixed issue where a new marker type’s Layer Icon setting was not respecting the default layer marker setting\nFixed issue where clicking a marker could open the context menu\nFixed issue where clicking a marker without a link could cause an error\nFixed issue with opening a marker link defined with alt-text\nFixed issue where resizing the leaf containing a map caused it to calculate marker positions incorrectly\nFixed issue where having the same map open in multiple windows was not adding markers correctly\nFixed issue where dragging a marker created on a map open in multiple views would not drag correctly on other maps\nFixed issue where turning the plugin off would leave map tiles in random locations on open notes\nFixed issue where showing the note preview of a note with a map that is already open in the workspace would cause the map to be disassociated\n\n2.1.0 §\n\nAdded marker parameter in code block\nFixed issue where importing a CSV file that changed a marker on an open map failed to update the marker information\n\n2.0.0 §\n\nAdded ability to export marker data to a CSV file\nAdded ability to import marker data from a CSV file\nAdded Obsidian-like file chooser to marker link path\n\n1.3.0 §\n\nRemoved requirement for file path in marker target\nAdded ability to target blocks in marker target\n\n1.2.0 §\n\nAdd rudimentary distance calculation between two points on the map\nFixed issue where opening the same map in multiple leaves could cause one map to de-render\n\n1.1.0 §\n\nMaps now recalculate their sizing when the window is resized\n\n1.0.0 §\n\nSwitch to proper semantic versioning\nAdded Note Preview setting\n\nThis setting displays the Obsidian page preview when you hover over a linked marker\n\n\nMap height can now be in provided as a percentage\n\n0.3.1 §\n\nAdded image map layers\n\nIt is now possible to have an arbitrary number of image maps layered on top of each other by supplying multiple images to the code block\nMarkers created on a specific layer are only displayed when that layer is active\nNavigation between layers is done using the layer control box in the top right\n\n\n\n0.2.2 §\n\nAdded real-world maps\nAdded latitude and longitude options\nAdded zoom delta option\nAdded tooltip display on markers that link to notes\nBug fixes\n\nInstallation §\nFrom within Obsidian §\nFrom Obsidian v0.9.8, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:\n\nOpen Settings &gt; Third-party plugin\nMake sure Safe mode is off\nClick Browse community plugins\nSearch for this plugin\nClick Install\nOnce installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin\n\nFrom GitHub §\n\nDownload the Latest Release from the Releases section of the GitHub Repository\nExtract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault’s plugins folder: &lt;vault&gt;/.obsidian/plugins/\nNote: On some machines the .obsidian folder may be hidden.

Something simmetrical) was a neutral evil object with some mind controlling powers. It was broken in 2 pieces a few years ago by a group of drows. This caused the object to split its personality, one part is CE, one is LE alignment.\nBoth the objects were captured by a group of dwarves. Two of the bosses got gifted the objects as honour for the won battle against the drows but the objects got hold of them. They despise each other and can communicate telepathically in 30 feet to all intelligent creatures.\nPosing as the original dwarves, they start a civil war a few months ago, still ongoing. No word of it has reached the surface yet, no one exits and they are insular city to begin with.\nPresent situation: §\nPCs find the dwarven city with light security outside. Each faction is trying to conquer the entire city, each one has control on one of the gates of the city, which are small fortresses. The middle part is no man’s land, with dwarven refugees that try to survive and frequent skirmishes between the 2. The original kings were killed by the 2 factions.\nPCs will encounter the chaotic faction first. A single dwarf which captured another of the legal faction, reay to be killed on the spot. They will explain their POVs and the PCs can choose if siding or become neutral and search the object.\nThe chaotic faction believes themselves as fighters for the freedom against a vile dictator.\nThe legal faction is convinced the others only want to make a coup and destroy the 2-king monarchy that was present until now.\nClues about the object:\n\nLatest news in the local journal talks about a magnificent object found in the latest victory against the drows.\nIf they inquire about the object, no ones know where it is. If they speak with both bosses, they will notice that both are wearing or are near the object, which are specular and identical.\nIf they examine one of the objects, traces of being broken can be found. If they examine both, the connection is evindent.\nDetect magic will show great magic potential on both objects. Ludvic will know they are intelligent after studying them closely. With a Perception DC 20, it can be seen that the object have the same style and their shape suggests they could be united.\n\nProbable resolutions:\n\nPCs side with one of the factions. They help them conquest some point of interest in the city, then look at how both faction treat survivors in the no man’s land without pity. After that, they will be asked to help conquest the base of the other faction. After defeating a faction, they will find one of the objects. Connecting the dots will be simple.\nIf they don’t side, the only way is to take possession of both objects. They will alert their slaves telepathically, they want their army.\n\nIn both cases, a ritual needs to be done to unify the pieces. The wizard in Phandalin can do it, otherwise the instructions can be found in the treasury with the other objects taken from the drows."},"D&D-Campaign/World/Nations/Kingdom-of-To'kar":{"title":"Kingdom of To'kar","links":["D&D-Campaign/World/Religions/Milushi","Demonic-Rift","D&D-Campaign/World/Nations/Technomancy-of-Aziria","D&D-Campaign/World/Nations/Vritus-Empire","D&D-Campaign/World/Nations/Domains-of-Neverwinter/Domains-of-Neverwinter"],"tags":[],"content":"Themes: Precarity and Unity.

If unsure, you can use the Behavior Meaning Table after rolling for inspiration.\n\nCharacter Actions §\n\nTalks, Exposition: The NPC decides to engage in conversation in a way that changes the current Context. If the NPC was doing something physical, such as fighting, they either stop doing that to talk or do both, whichever seems most logical. If they already were talking, then they change the subject and talk about something else.\nYou have two options to figure out what it is they specifically say. The first is to logic your way to it using the Context and Disposition and going with what you would most expect them to say.\nYour second option is to roll on the Description Meaning Tables at the back of this book or ask a Fate Question. Use the result as inspiration to come up with an interpretation of what the NPC says.\nPerforms An Ambiguous Action: The NPC does something that has nothing to do with the current Context, thus changing the Context. It’s a neutral Action. To determine what the Action is, roll on the Action Meaning Tables at the back of this book or ask a Fate Question.\nActs Out Of PC Interest: The NPC does something that is in the best interest of the Player Character, changing the current Context. If there is more than one PC, either have this result refer to the Player Character dealing most directly with the NPC or determine it randomly.\nWhat constitutes “PC interest” can be a lot of things, but it is something that will help the Character, probably aiding her in the completion of a goal. You can either choose the most logical and likely behavior for the NPC, or roll on the Description or Action Meaning Tables to get inspiration for what it is or ask a Fate Question.\nNPC Continues: In keeping with the current Context, the NPC will continue with their latest Action if their Disposition is Passive. If their Disposition is Active, they will either continue with their latest Action or, if it makes sense, they will take that Action to the “next level”. What that next level actually entails is up to you, whatever seems the most logical. An NPC who is driving a car through city streets as he is chased by the Player Characters may start off evading by driving fast. If you take that up a level, maybe he is now taking risks, such as weaving between other cars and running red lights. Or, maybe it just makes more sense that they keep doing what they’re doing. Our NPC driver just keeps driving fast.\nIf this is the first result you’ve rolled for the NPC in this Scene then treat this as a Context Action. No Action has been established for the NPC yet so there is no Action to continue.\nSome of the NPC Continues results of the NPC Action Table show a +2 or -2. This is a modifier to their Disposition Score and should be applied, changing the Score. This has no effect on the NPC’s Action unless it changes their Disposition from Passive to Active or the other way around. A change in Disposition status like this should be noted in the NPC’s Actions; going from Passive to Active should take this Action up a notch and make it noticeably more active, while going from Active to Passive should tone down their Action from what they have been doing. In our chase example, if the NPC’s Disposition is Passive, the GM may interpret NPC Continues results to mean he keeps doing what he’s doing. But if he gets an NPC Continues +2 result and it pushes the Disposition Score from Passive to Active, the GM may decide that this means the Action needs to be taken up a notch and the NPC starts taking dangerous driving risks.\nContext Action: The Character is changing his Action from what he has been doing, but the next Action will still be within the current Context. Consider the Context and the Character’s Disposition and go with the most likely and logical Action you think the NPC would take in response to what is going on. If the NPC was already performing an Action, he will stop that Action and switch to a new one, but the new Action will still be something you would expect them to do within the current Context. This will be the next most likely thing you think they would do.\nGives Something: The NPC gives the Player Characters something, changing the current Context. If there is more than one PC, either have this result refer to the Player Character dealing most directly with the NPC or determine it randomly. What is given may not necessarily be helpful. The “something” in question can be anything, from an object to information. Whatever it is, the NPC is imparting something to the PC and it should have relevance.\nEither go with the most logical thing this may be (especially if that logical thing springs to mind immediately), or roll on the Descriptions Meaning Tables to get inspiration for what it is or ask a Fate Question.\nSeeks To End The Encounter: The NPC has had enough of this encounter and wishes to end it, which clearly changes the Context. This might mean ending a conversation, walking away from a situation, stopping a fight, etc. This result doesn’t necessarily mean that the encounter actually ends, just that the NPC tries to end it.\nIf there is a logical interpretation to this that springs to mind then you can go with that. If an obvious logical answer doesn’t spring to mind, roll on the Action Meaning Tables or ask a Fate Question.\nActs Out Of Self Interest: The NPC does something that is clearly for their own gain and it changes the current Context. You can look to their Disposition and the current Context to understand what it is that the NPC wants. If a logical interpretation jumps out at you based on these factors, then run with it. Otherwise, roll on the Action Meaning Tables to determine what the NPC does or ask a Fate Question. Whatever it is, it should further their own interests\nTakes Something: The NPC takes something from the PC and it changes the current Context. If there is more than one PC, then the NPC either takes something from the PC they are most directly dealing with or roll the PC randomly.\nCauses Harm: The NPC tries to hurt the PC. Like the other results in this range on the NPC Action Table, this Action should change the Context. If there is more than one PC, then the NPC either hurts the PC they are mostdirectly dealing with or roll the PC randomly.\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean that the harm caused is physical. Maybe the NPC says something cruel to the Player Character. Maybe they left a nasty note. Maybe they just shot the PC a dirty look. Let the Context and Disposition guide you.\n"},"Mythic-2e/Extra/Fluid-Scene/Fluid-Scene-Flow":{"title":"Fluid Scene Flow","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nPose a Scene Question (Scene continues as expected?)\nRoll d10.\n\nUpdate CF based on result\n\nLists are updated on the fly during play.\n"},"Mythic-2e/Extra/Keyed-Scene-Events/Keyed-Scene-Event-Template":{"title":"Keyed Scene Event Template","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptionNameName hereEventEvent description hereTriggerTrigger conditions here"},"Mythic-2e/Extra/Keyed-Scene-Events/Keyed-Scene-Events":{"title":"Keyed Scene Events","links":["Mythic-2e/Extra/Keyed-Scene-Events/Keyed-Scene-Event-Template"],"tags":[],"content":"Keyed Scene Events §\nUseful to control the flow of story and ensure something happens or to keep the story on schedule.

Character Feeds\n\n\n\nIn my solo roleplaying games I like the world to feel like it’s alive, like it will keep on existing and moving even if I decided to have my character sit down and just make a cottage out in the middle of the woods and grow mushrooms for thirty years.\nThere’s a lot of tools to this end, ranging from the simple, to the complex. In this article I present a middle-of-the-road approach in terms of complexity and bookkeeping, targeted more at simulationist players who like to keep a strong fog of war. It is built to be used with the Mythic GME 2e ruleset, but feel free to convert it to other oracles or rulesets and publish those conversions.\nIf you just want the tool and don’t care for the explanation, jump down to News Feeds.\n1. Existing Approaches §\nIn general I’ve seen two categories of approaches to the problem of a living world for solo roleplayers. The first is to use the facilities included within your system. The second is to construct a system of faction simulation, usually using a concept of faction turns, and using the goals and assets of a faction to drive events in the world.\nImagine the following scenario in a generic medieval fantasy setting. A monastery of some order of clerics has sway over an area of land, with some villages and serfs within it farming and providing for the clerics. A neighboring duchy has a castle in a thriving town with a significant garrison.\nA particularly bad storm tears through the area, causing significant flooding, and ruining a large portion of the grain, likely causing a poor harvest and potentially a food shortage over the winter.\nYour character has determined this by traveling through the area and noting the sights they have seen, and the storm blew through causing them some trouble, so none of this has been remote or off-screen for your character, they have lived it. As a player, you can make the inference about the potential for a poor harvest, and you want to see what happens.\nUsing the first approach, you would now make some record that this is an ongoing event that you want to keep track of. Over time, random events may take place which refer to it, and if you want to keep getting specific information about it, then your best bet is to use your oracle unprompted to learn how things progress.\nDoing things in this manner will generally be very vague as you learn only basic information from your oracle, and it may be hard to interpret if you haven’t been in the area that the situation affects recently. Especially I find it difficult to account for many key players within a collection of related events over time.\nUsing the second approach, you would begin by statting out multiple factions, perhaps the monks, the serfs, the duke, and the city guard. Each faction will have some goals, some assets, or other stats your faction system requires, and when you have time pass you will take a faction turn, causing the factions to interact with each other and their assets.\nFactions run in this manner also do not satisfy me because they require a significant amount of bookkeeping, they reveal large amounts of information about the factions as you stat them out regardless of if your player should know that information, and in my experience these systems usually put a large focus on the interplay between factions, while lacking much facility for factions interacting with the world. Representing a bad harvest because of a storm may be challenging. This does come with the benefit however that it is easy to keep track of many key players over a complex set of events.\nThese two approaches take something of opposite sides. One focuses entirely on the tangible outcomes that the character can see or experience, the other focuses on groups of people and their motivations and allows world events to flow from there.\n2. Goals §\nWith the groundwork of the existing categories of solutions and what I consider their flaws for my own usecases above, collected below are my goals for News Feeds.\n\nWorld events should be able to cross to the current context where appropriate\nRequired bookkeeping should be minimal, but clearly defined; players should not have to invent a new format for bookkeeping after reading this\nPlayer knowledge should not expand significantly beyond character knowledge\nCollections of key players and events should be able to organically grow without significant risk of losing detail\nEvents the player loses interest in should be able to easily fade into the background\nBoth inter-faction and faction-world interactions should be easily representable\nKeep additional rules beyond the base Mythic GME 2e to a minimum\n\n2.1. Non-Goals §\nIn addition to trying the above, the following are explicit non-goals for the News Feeds system.\n\nRepresenting entire factions in the world\nCreating a detailed simulation\nTo be portable to other oracles without modification\n\n3. News Feeds §\nA News Feed is a way to keep track of an ongoing situation that your character may not be directly involved with, but that they may hear about. It has its own lists, as well as its own event log, similar to the adventure journal from Mythic.\n3.1. Creating a News Feed §\nWhen a situation occurs in the world that you want to keep track of but that you don’t want to be a central part of your adventure, instead of creating it as a thread, pull out a fresh copy of the News Feed sheet, and write down a summary of the situation at the top, followed by the general scope of the news. Record this second part in pencil, as it may change over time.\nThe scope of the news should indicate how your character might hear about the goings on related to the situation. For the above example of a storm causing a poor harvest, it may be county-level news, which means any time you hear about goings on in the county, you might hear news about the harvest. For a small feud between family members, the scope would be the family, you’ll hear news from family and friends, but it is unlikely to be gossiped about at a bar the next town over. Sieges and wars may be scoped to the nation they are in.\nSome scopes may be a bit more abstract, for example an active robbery in a city may have a scope of “police scanner”, meaning you may hear information about it when tuning into the police scanner, but you might not hear about it from anyone else in town.\nNext, record the time increment of this news feed. The time increment is how long you expect between major developments in the situation. For the bad harvest example, this time increment may be several weeks, for a family feud it could be months or years, for a siege or war it may be days or weeks, for an active robbery it may be 10 minutes.\nKeep in mind that this is not the minimum time between events happening, but is instead the average time between major events that may shape how the situation moves forward.\nThe sheet also includes a half-sized threads list and characters list, and a number of event summary boxes.\nStart by adding in the primary characters and threads that you can think of associated with the current situation.\nFor our bad harvest situation, we may add the following to our lists:\nFor threads we add “Damaged Crops”. For characters we add “serfs”, “monks”, and “duke”.\nThis is our groundwork for how the situation might play out. Now we have completed the initial bookkeeping for our News Feed, and we may resume normal play.\n3.2. Using a News Feed §\nAs you continue play, you will want to hear news about what is going on with the situation which has been created as a News Feed. In general, there are two ways for this to occur.\nThe first is by random events with the Remote Event focus. Whenever you roll this focus, you may choose to make the event about a News Feed. If you do, randomly select from among your active news feeds, and then generate a News Event as normal, and interpret this as a normal Remote Event, requiring you determine how your character gets the news.\nThe second way is by interacting with the scope of a News Feed. Any time your character interacts with the scope of a News Feed you have an opportunity to ask a Fate Question, “Do I hear any news?” If you get a Yes answer, you move on to generating a news event. On a No, you don’t hear any news. On an Exceptional No, you cannot make any more attempts to hear news this scene. On an Exceptional Yes, a major event is generated, regardless of how long it has been since the character last heard news.\nBeyond just generating news events, a News Feed represents real actions which take place within the world, and which can help to shape it outside of where your character is actively participating. This is important to keep in mind as your character moves about the world. News events should always be kept in mind as a part of your adventure context as you interpret the results of Fate Questions, of Discovering Meaning, or resolving Random Events. If your character goes to where the news feed is taking place, the events migrate from being a news feed to being a part of your adventure.\nWhen your character becomes relevant to how a news feed will continue, migrate any relevant threads and characters from the News Feed’s thread and character lists to your adventure lists, and avoid generating news events, instead playing out the events of the situation directly.\nConversely, when your character moves away from an ongoing situation, if you are interested in how it turns out consider creating a News Feed, or if the situation was already represented by a News Feed before your character arrived at the location, update the lists to match the present situation, and summarize how it changed in a new event in the News Feed’s event log.\nAs you play, also periodically consider if the labeled scope and time increment still make sense. Perhaps an active robbery with a scope of “police scanner” and a time increment of 10 minutes has evolved over time to a hostage situation and it’s important to change the scope to “local news” and the time increment to 1 hour.\n3.3. Generating News Events §\nTo generate a news event, start by considering when you last generated a news event, or when you created the news feed. If the amount of in-game time that has passed is more than the time increment, the news event generated will be a major event. Otherwise, it will be a minor event.\nIn either case, start by rolling on the relevant News Event Focus table. This gives you the event focus for your news event. Next, roll on an appropriate elements table. The actions elements table is a reasonable default for most results, as with Random Events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1d100Minor News Event Focus1d100Major News Event Focus1-15Rumored Event1-10New Character16-30Character Action11-15Remove Character31-35Character Positive16-30Character Action36-40Character Negative31-35Character Positive41-50Move Toward a Thread36-40Character Negative51-60Move Away From a Thread41-55Move Toward a Thread61-70Current Context56-70Move Away From a Thread71-80Roll Two Minor Events71-75New Thread81-100Roll One Major Event76-90Close a Thread91-95Roll Two Major Events96-100Roll Three Minor Events\n3.3.1. Rumored Event §\nA rumored event is an event which has a dubious source or which has otherwise not been confirmed. These events may come to nothing, or they may be true. Either way they will change how their subject is perceived.\nIf after rolling on an elements table you are unsure of the interpretation, consider rolling on the News Feed’s characters list to determine who the rumor is about.\n3.3.2. Character Action §\nRoll on the News Feed’s characters list to determine the character who is taking the action, then the elements table you feel is most appropriate.\nThis is an action that a character takes, it may be related to an ongoing thread, or connected to another character, but it should represent at least an active choice, or perhaps a physical action on the part of the character.\nWhen this event is minor, the action should not have any immediate impact on the outcome of a thread. Major character actions may permanently change the outcome of the situation that gave rise to the News Feed.\nThese sorts of permanent changes, if you feel guided by the prompt, may in some cases overlap with some other options on the table. If you feel a character action would close a thread, initiate a new one, or add or remove a character, then the action should have those effects. The existence of the other table entries should not hold you back, as they guarantee that those changes occur, while Character Action does not.\n3.3.3. Character Positive / Negative §\nRoll on the News Feed’s characters list to determine which character will be affected most by the event, and then on the elements table you feel is most appropriate.\nThe event need not require any activity on the part of the rolled character, and may involve other characters as well, but the interpretation should result in a net benefit or penalty for that character in the scope of this News Feed.\nAs a minor event this should not be an unrecoverable loss or an inordinate gain, but should reflect the natural ebb and flow of events.\nAs a major event, this should permanently change the character’s relationship with the other characters or the threads.\n3.3.4. New Character §\nIntroduce a new character to the situation. You may make whatever elements rolls you wish for inspiration, but I recommend making a roll on the Characters elements table followed by a roll on the Actions elements table.\nAs this is can only appear as a major event, the new character should be a major player in the situation, and should immediately have some impact on the outcome of it either simply through their presence, or by taking some notable action.\nKeep in mind that characters may be literal characters, they may represent factions or other groups, or they may represent other aspects of the situation or world which may appear to act on their own. Perhaps a season could be embodied as a character, or a mountain or forest, or a force of nature like particularly active freak weather, or a group of animals. Anything which will act as a repeated element of actions taken within the context of the News Feed.\n3.3.5. Remove Character §\nRoll on the characters table and an appropriate elements table to determine the method by which they are removed from the situation. This does not need to mean a character dies or is incapacitated, it simply means that they will no longer contribute meaningfully to a situation. Perhaps they have settled on a course of action and will not be swayed by further events, maybe they move to a new location no longer impacted by the situation. Maybe they withdraw and choose to act as a passive party.\nAll this requires is that in some way the character is no longer a significant player in the situation which prompted the creation of the News Feed.\n3.3.6. Move Toward/Away From a Thread §\nRoll on the News Feed’s threads list to determine which thread is affected, and then roll on the elements table you feel is most appropriate.\nThe event should bring the thread closer to a conclusion, or introduce a snag in it which will keep it relevant for longer.\nAs a minor event these should be smaller amounts of progress that could be reversed by character actions or similar.\nAs a major event these should be irreversible progress or significant snags which can only be resolved by additional major events.\nIn some cases it may be appropriate for moving towards a thread to close it, or moving away from a thread to introduce another, although both should only occur with major events. The existence of the new thread and close a thread entries on the table should not discourage you from doing this, they are a guarantee, while movement of a thread is only an opportunity.\n3.3.7. New Thread §\nIntroduce a new thread to the situation, using a roll from an appropriate elements table as inspiration.\nThis can only appear as a major event, and represents a new emerging aspect of the situation which most or all of the characters will care about, and which will take significant time to resolve.\n3.3.8. Close a Thread §\nRoll a thread from the News Feed’s thread list. Using a roll from an appropriate elements table as inspiration, find a way to bring the thread to a conclusion, so that it is no longer a major concern for the characters.\nThis can only appear as a major event, but is more common than introducing a New Thread. This allows News Feeds to naturally tend towards a resolution over time.\n3.3.9. Current Context §\nA Current Context event acts as an extension of the most recent events which have taken place. Roll on an appropriate elements table, then look at your event log and choose the most recent major event or any subsequent minor events which you can see a way to extend with the result.\nThis extension should act as a continuation of that event, and it may be appropriate to record that continuation with the original event in the News Feed’s event log.\n3.3.10. Roll X Minor Events §\nAs the entry says, this requires a number minor events be rolled. If you roll this result as a secondary roll, ignore it and reroll.\nThis means if you are rolling three minor events as a result of a roll on the Major News Event Focus table, you should ignore results requiring you to roll two additional minor events, and that a roll requesting three minor events after rolling a major event from the Minor News Event Focus table should also be ignored.\n3.3.11. Roll X Major Events §\nRoll a number of major events. If you roll this as a result of a secondary roll, ignore it and reroll, as with the Roll X Minor Events results.\n3.4. Interpreting News Events §\nSomething that has been mentioned in a few specific table entries’ descriptions, but which I wish to call special attention to, is that the table entries are not the only way for new characters to appear, for characters to be removed, or for new threads to be introduced or old ones to be closed.\nSometimes a part of the interpretation of an event will imply one of those things, and you should feel free to record them on your News Feed’s lists. Something important to consider when an event implies one of these things is whether the event is major or minor. In general, large-scale changes like this should only occur during major events, but if you cannot find a minor interpretation of your prompt when rolling a minor event, prefer using your first instinct even if it is major to invoking the I Dunno rule.\n3.5. When to Create a News Feed §\nNews Feeds have a specific and narrow focus in the manner I have envisioned them, so when to use them and what you should represent with them becomes an important question. You may of course adapt these mechanics to suit whatever situation you feel is appropriate, but in this section I describe in more detail the sorts of things I expect these rules to be useful for.\nIn general, I would categorize events which may turn up in your game into three categories. World events, adventure events, and news events. These correspond roughly with how I would recommend resolving each of them.\nWorld events are things which happen in the world but which are not required to have any connection to any existing aspect of your game. The first time you arrive in a town, you may wish to ask what has been happening in the town lately. This would be a world event, as it has no established connection to your game, but the interpretation of the answer may establish one.\nWorld events can generally be resolved with fate questions or discovering meaning. If a sheriff in the wild west is chasing down an outlaw, they might ask a fate question when walking into a new town about whether their mark is there already, and if not they might ask about the recent happenings. The first is a fate question, the second a chance to discover meaning (although after this first encounter may be a good time to establish a Place Feed).\nAdventure events are the events of your game. They have a direct impact to the direction your game takes, and are centered around your characters. These are events which take place either as you play, or as a part of the threads you have established within your adventure lists.\nAdventure events are resolved through conventional play, and are prompted either by your expectations or by random events which are triggered by Mythic.\nNews events are events which surround a specific and well-defined situation which your character is already familiar with through other means, and which you as a player or your character wish to keep updated on, but which do not have an immediate and direct impact on your adventure.\nThese events could have any scale associated with them, affecting anything from just a few people up to the entire universe, but they still have a limited and specific set of threads and characters which are relevant to them. In this way it might be relevant to have a News Feed about a new guard captain’s attempts to crack down on the local thieves guild, but it would not be relevant to have a news feed for “everything that happens in the city”.\nIn this way you may have several distinct News Feeds which talk about some or all of the same characters, but which have a different set of related goals, connections, scope, and time. For a mafia family’s drama you may have a News Feed connected to the son of the don being under investigation from the FBI, a News Feed about the second cousin who is up and coming and looks to be the better choice for a successor to the don than his own son, and a News Feed about a gang encroaching on the don’s territory and affecting his business. Each of these news feeds will have a number of overlapping characters, but each one progresses at a different rate of time, and each one will have scopes for news about them which are distinct.\nIn this example you might see the second cousin looking to become the next don have a time increment of one month and a scope of “crime families”, allowing you to hear about it from contacts in the organized crime division of the police, from members of the family itself, or from other notable criminal figures in the area. The investigation by the FBI might have a time increment of 2 weeks and a scope of “FBI investigation” meaning you can only gain news about it by directly interacting with the investigation, perhaps by hacking into the FBI records, by having an insider contact you, or by being a member of the FBI assigned to another job. For the gang war between the don and the encroaching gang it might have a time increment of one week, and a scope of “local news” because big activities they take will start to appear directly from news outlets, and as rumors from people living in the affected areas.\n3.6. The End of a Feed §\nOver time, the primary situation that a news feed is built around will come to a natural end. Maybe the active robbery turned hostage situation has been resolved, the perpetrators are in custody, and the hostages made it out alive. Maybe winter has come and gone and while there was some trouble with a food shortage, the monastery and nearby town managed to pull through and this year’s crop is looking good. Maybe the don was taken down by the FBI and the second cousin has stepped up to take his place, ousting the son from the family and bringing the usefulness of the FBI investigation to an end, leaving them with nothing to worry about but the turf war.\nThis will happen either as all active threads in a news feed come to a close, which the event tables are naturally tuned to do this over time, or as a central aspect of the situation resolves on its own, regardless of the state of the threads. This may be a season or event passing, or some large outside event changing the priorities of the participants in the feed, or other things that fit with the context of your adventure.\nAnother way a news feed may end is by the player losing interest or the character losing contact with the scope. In these cases the news feed doesn’t come to some conclusion, but rather fades out with time before being dropped entirely. In this case you may not realize that a news feed has truly ended until it comes up again in your adventure context, and you must deal with the aftermath.\nThese are all valid ways for a news feed to end. When you have realized that your news feed has ended, you should go through a few steps.\nTo begin, mark the news feed as concluded. If aspects of the feed get taken up again at a later date, start it as a new feed. Next, review the whole sequence of events associated with the news feed. Any permanent changes which occurred as a part of the news feed you should try to keep fresh in your mind as you interact with the scope it was associated with. A well-executed news feed will have lasting impacts on the world even once they are concluded. This would be a good time to record any permanent changes to the world, characters, or relationships in your associated notes if you keep them.\nIf the news feed you are concluding did not resolve its primary situation, make a special note that you must resolve the situation’s aftermath when you come back to the feed’s scope.\n3.7. Aftermath of News Feeds §\nWhen your characters enter the scope of a news feed long after news was last heard about it, either because the player lost interest in it, the character lost access to news about the feed, or any other reason, the effects of the outcome of the news feed should be visible, but generating events until every thread closes would be a long and cumbersome process.\nIn this situation, a minimal set of events should be generated that will provide a conclusion to each part of the feed you feel is relevant to the world. This can be as few as one, or as many as one per thread.\nWhen you first interact with the scope of a news feed which has not been active for a long enough time that you feel the situation should be resolved, look over your news feed sheet. Select from the threads list the threads you think would have the most impact on the world after the resolution of the feed.\nNext, for each selected thread, roll a single event on the Major News Event Focus table, ignoring results that ask you to make additional rolls. Regardless of the event focus rolled, add to the context for this event that the interpretation must result in the thread being resolved, and keep in mind that the event may take place over a long period of time.\nOnce this is complete, you will have a number of additional events for your news feed which collectively conclude the feed. Integrate these new events into your world’s context, and then continue play.\nIt is possible that during the resolution of the news feed additional questions about the world come up or situations emerge which are not immediately resolved by the events which resolve the initial news feed. This is alright, and may prompt you to create new news feeds to track them. These feeds should also be relatively easy to populate because they can draw on character lists from the feed being concluded, and the central premise for them is set up by the event you wish to track.\n4. The Big Example §\n5. Specialized Feeds §\nThese rules are fairly general, and may be applied in use cases beyond the primary one outlined in the above text. Here are some ideas for other types of news feeds which you might want to use.\n5.1. Place Feeds §\nPlace feeds act as a way to track the happenings in an important location that your characters repeatedly visit. These feeds are unique in that they don’t ever conclude except for in extraordinary circumstances, or by your characters leaving and never coming back.\nIn this type of feed, if all the active threads conclude the feed is not completed, it is simply an uneventful time at the location. When events are generated and no threads exist, you should bias your interpretations towards creating new threads when possible, to keep activity going.\nWhen creating these news feeds, consider adding characters who you have not met but who you know are active in the location. Perhaps the local government, an influential guild or three, a local hero, a subsection of the populace like miners in a mining town, and similar.\nAs a general rule, I’d recommend setting a time increment for these feeds that is a bit more abstract. Also create a secondary, shorter time increment. When the characters are within the bounds of the scope of the place feed, roll up one minor event for each of these shorter time increments during standard play, or during downtime instead roll a major event at each of the larger time increment.\nIn addition, you may wish to use the Aftermath rules whenever the party is gone from the location for a while or spend very significant amounts of downtime within it, but slightly adapted.\nAfter you have rolled the completing events of the aftermath, remove any threads you did not roll completing events for. Next, look over the characters list and remove any which you feel only have relevance to the place feed in the context of the threads which are now complete. Alternatively you may leave them on the list, and only remove them if you need to invoke the I Dunno rule when they come up in future events.\nIf you take particular interest in some thread active in the feed, consider generating a news feed for it. When you do, remove the thread from the place feed, and add any characters from the list which feel relevant. Any characters who have no involvement in other threads in the place feed and who were migrated to the new feed should be removed from the place feed. Finally, continue with the normal process for creating a news feed, setting its own scope and time increment, and adding any new threads or characters which feel appropriate.\nIf you have a news feed which grew out of a thread for the place feed and you need to run an aftermath for the place feed, consider treating the news feed as the original thread that it grew out of and generating only a single event for the whole feed. This may help keep the amount of work required to resume play after entering the place again to a minimum. Keep time increments in mind as you do this, however. If the time that has passed since the players last interacted with the feed is appropriate to simply generate a major event rather than running an aftermath, prefer that and keep the news feed going while the rest of the town’s threads are resolved as an aftermath.\n5.2. Character Feeds §\nCharacter feeds are very much like place feeds, but instead of following what happens in a location over time, it follows the life of a single character. This is an opportunity to make a more detailed life story for a character as you repeatedly interact with them, as an alternative to other detailed options like The Adventure Crafter or BOLD.\nAdapt all of the suggestions for place feeds, but instead of centering the feed around a location, center it around the character."},"Mythic-2e/General-Flow":{"title":"General Flow","links":["Mythic-2e/Extra/Mythic-Backstory-Generation/Character-Backstory","Crafter-Series/Adventure-Crafter/The-Adventure-Crafter-Worksheet","Mythic-2e/Extra/Keyed-Scene-Events/Keyed-Scene-Events","Mythic-2e/Extra/Mystery-Matrix/Mystery-Matrix-Flow","Mythic-2e/Core/Altered-Scene-Adjustment-Table","Mythic/Fate-Questions","Mythic-2e/Core/Random-Event-Focus-Table","Mythic-2e/Adv-Crafter-with-Mythic-2e","Crafter-Series/Event-Crafter/General-Flow","Mythic-2e/Core/Meaning-Tables/Action-Meaning-Table-2e","Mythic-2e/Core/Meaning-Tables/Descriptions-Meaning-Table-2e","Mythic-2e/Core/Fate-Check-2e","Mythic-2e/Core/Choosing-Event-Focus","Mythic-2e/Extra/Behavior-Check/Mythic-Simplified-Behavior-Check","Mythic-2e/Core/Meaning-Tables/Characters-Conversations","Mythic-2e/Core/Meaning-Tables/Characters-Actions,-General","Mythic-2e/Core/Meaning-Tables/Characters-Actions,-Combat","Mythic-2e/Core/Meaning-Tables/Animal-Actions"],"tags":[],"content":"Scene Setup §\n\nFirst Scene only §\nChaos Factor starts at 5.\nIf using Adventure Crafter:\n\nChoose Themes for this Adventure.\nGenerate the first scene as a Turning Point.\nYou can prefill some Plotlines or Characters as needed.\n\nIf you want, for PCs/NPCs/Factions/Objects/Worlds you can generate a Character Backstory.\n\n\nDuplicate The Adventure Crafter Worksheet to work on it.\nDefine any Keyed Scene Events if needed.\n\nIf doing an investigation/searching information, use the Mystery Matrix Flow.\nDetermine Expected Scene. §\nCheck Chaos Factor:\nRoll 1d10.

The most will be listed in the system’s requirements.\nUsing this system, you’ll still get a pass or fail, but the results will also deliver alterations to the results such as advantageous failures, or despairing successes. These kinds of results are meant to help the players as well as the game master exercise their narrative creativity and drive an emergent narrative that may change on the fly. Using some cancellation, bounded results and very little math, this system should help deliver rules to adjudicate tasks and give results. The rules won’t cover everything, but then a rule set never has and requires a bit of spirit of the law to adjudicate fairly and consistently. More on this in the Game Mastering section, which is highly recommended everyone reads. The role-play system is for everyone and being The Core Mechanic is easy, the rest helps players and Game Masters expand play.\nRequirements to play §\nThe tools to play the Narrative D6 Role-Playing System, or ND6 RPS or ND6, should be fairly accessible. A friendly local game store should carry multi-polyhedral dice sets. The rest is for notes and other writings.\n\nOne set of standard polyhedral RPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)\nTwo sets of 4-12 d6s. One set one color for Positive Dice (PD). One set one color for Negative Dice (ND).\nIndex Cards.\nUS Letter Paper or graph paper for larger character sheets.\nPencils and pens to write information down.\n\nThe thoughts with the graph paper is that some players are do-it-yourselfers who like to create their own versions of character sheets or inventory layouts or just mapping things. The index cards can be used for smaller versions of the character sheets for mobile or quick play.\nIf you find that you don’t have two different sets of colored dice, but you have a permanent marker and some dice from your local convenience store, you can color one set of dice a different color. For instance, on my desk, I have one red and one green permanent marker and 10 six-sided dice from the store. I colored on set of five green, and one set of six red.\nThe Core Mechanic §\nThe ND6 RPG uses a d6 dice-pooling system as its Core Mechanic. Here are the steps to perform a Check for every action in the game:\nThe Check §\n\nEach character has six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each attribute has a value of 1-5.\nThe starting dice pool is made up of one Positive Die (PD) and one Negative Die (ND). This represents the character as a thinking individual.\nAdd +1 PD for each Boon that applies to the check. Boons can be Skill Ranks, Good Quality Items, or Situational Modifiers. There is no limit to how many Boons can be provided.\nAdd +1 ND for each Bane that applies to the check. Banes can be Difficulty Level (see Difficulty Chart), Poor Quality Items, or Situational Modifiers. There is no limit to how many Banes can be provided.\nRoll the dice pools separately.\nCancel any matches between the Positive Dice Pool and Negative Dice Pool.\nEach PD that remains and is equal to or less than the character’s attribute counts as a Success. Only one Success is needed to succeed.\nIf no PDs roll under the attribute or are left after canceling, the check is a Failure.\nIf there are more PDs than NDs left, the character has Advantages equal to the number of PDs minus NDs. This happens regardless of Success or Failure.\nIf there are more NDs than PDs left, the character has Threats equal to the number of NDs minus PDs. This happens regardless of Success or Failure.\nAny matches on remaining PD count as Triumphs. This happens regardless of Success or Failure.\nTwo or more sixes rolled on remaining ND count as Despairs. This happens regardless of Success or Failure.\n\nThe default dice pool consists of 1 PD and 1 ND. With this pool, players will either succeed or fail without any Advantages or Threats. To succeed, the player needs to roll at least one PD equal to or under their character’s attribute rank, which starts at 1. To fail, either the PD needs to be greater than the attribute rank, or the ND needs to cancel the PD by matching its value.\nAdvantages are positive outcomes that happen regardless of success or failure. They can include discovering extra information or completing the task more efficiently. Threats are negative outcomes that happen regardless of success or failure. They can include alerting enemies or damaging equipment.\nTriumphs and Despairs are special results that combine Success or Failure with Advantages or Threats. A Triumph is a Success and an Advantage, while a Despair is a Failure and a Threat. Triumphs and Despairs do not cancel each other out.\nTo increase their chances of Success or generate Advantages, players can add Boons to their character. Boons are bonuses such as skill ranks, good quality items, or situational modifiers, and they provide a single +1PD per Boon. To increase the chances of Failure or generate Threats, players can add Banes to their character. Banes are negative factors such as lacking skills or having poor quality equipment, and they provide a single +1ND per Bane. There is no limit to the size of the dice pool.\nDifficulty Chart §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty RatingNegative DiceEasy+1NDModerate+2NDChallenging+3NDImprobable+4NDImpossible+5ND\nExample Check §\nTrudy has a character named Olyssia the fighter. Olyssia’s characteristics are rated as: Strength 4, Dexterity 2, Constitution 3, Intelligence 1 Wisdom 2 and Charisma 2. Olyssia has a +1PD long sword. One of her Traits is goading duelist for a +2PD when fighting a single target with only her sword. So, this sets the Dice Pool to: 1PD (starting) + 1PD for the sword, and +2PD for the Trait. The total Positive Dice pool is 4PD.\nThe target Olyssia is attempting to hit is a Moderate Difficulty for +2ND and has a Trait of Passive Fighter for +1ND against any aggressive targets. So, this sets up the Dice pool to: 1ND (starting) + 2ND for the Moderate difficulty + 1ND for Passive Duelist. This brings the Negative Dice pool to 4ND. An even split of Positive and Negative Dice.\nTrudy rolls the combined dice pool.\n\nPositive Dice Pool: [1, 3, 5, 6]\nNegative Dice Pool: [1, 2, 4, 6]\n\nTo resolve this check, Trudy starts by canceling matches. The ones match and sixes match, so those are removed from the pool. Trudy is left with a three and a five. The three is below Olyssia’s Strength Attribute of four, making this check a success! Next, Trudy checks for any Advantages. Being that there are an even number of Positive and Negative Dice left in the Pool, there are no Advantages or Threats. There are no doubles in the remaining Positive Dice so there is no Triumph. There are not any double sixes in the Negative Dice pool either, so there is no Despair.\nOlyssia is successful in her strike and deals damage according to the weapons damage rating. This example is very simple, and mainly geared towards one-shot sessions. If doing long-term play, characters have armor, weapons, gear, skills and traits adding more dice to the dice pool and making things get more interesting!\nOne-Shot Sessions §\nWhen using these mechanics during a one-shot session, use these recommendations:\n\nAssign 16 XP between the six attributes at a cost of 1 XP per point.\nCheck out the Traits section for a bit more flavor to one-shot characters.\n\nThese kinds of characters fit well on an index card. An example of what the index card layout can look like will be in the end of the book.\nLong-Term Play §\nIf players want to play a longer running game with awards and increases, read the rest of this book for how to build a character and progress them.\nCharacter Building §\nPlayers wanting characters that will be used for a long term adventure or campaign should follow the character building steps listed in this chapter.\n\nPick optional Hindrances (maximum of four).\nAssign points to Attributes (12 XP budget).\nFigure out Derived Statistics (Wounds, Toughness, Strain).\nAssign points to Skills (20 XP budget).\nDesign Traits and assign points (3 XP budget).\nPick or buy Equipment such as Armor, Weapons, Gear.\n\nIf the player wants to create a character that can wield awesome power:\n\nLearn and design Powers for the character’s setting and genre.\n\nPowers are discussed later in the book.\nHindrances §\n\nA character can have only a maximum of four Hindrances.\nHindrances provide 1 XP to a character’s XP budget.\nHindrances provide mechanical effects such as +1 ND to a dice pool.\n\nA Hindrance is a narrative and potentially a mechanical set back to a character. These can give permission to players to role play their character in accordance to these Hindrances. Hindrances are completely optional as well. If the Game Master allows it, characters can receive one XP per Hindrance to a maximum of four. This means that a character can only have four Hindrances. Also, if a Game Master allows it, characters can receive a ND to a dice pool and in some special circumstances a PD depending on the context.\nAn example of a Hindrance is “A Fear of Heights”. When the character is in a situation where they are chasing a target through a stair well and the target bursts out onto a roof top leaping from building to building, the player’s character would receive +1 ND if they attempt to follow their target across the roof tops.\nAttributes §\n\nCharacters have six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.\nCharacters start with a budget of 12 XP.\nEach attribute starts with a rank of 1.\nEach attribute rank increase costs the value of the rank in XP.\nThe maximum an attribute can be raised to is five ranks.\n\nAttributes are a way to describe the raw, intrinsic abilities of a character. When a character attempts to do something without a skill or a skill doesn’t cover the task at hand, characters use their attributes. The rank of an attribute dictates the target number a player needs to roll in order for their character to succeed at a task. This means that if an attribute is rank 3, the player needs to roll 3 or less in order to success. Rolling 4 or more on a die means it failed in this instance. When increasing an attribute’s rank, players must spend the number of ranks in XP. For instance, to go from rank 1 to 2, that is 2 XP. To go from 2 to 3, that is 3 XP. So to go from rank 1 to 3 is 5 XP in total.\nLet’s discuss the various attributes.\nStrength §\nStrength is a measure of a character’s pure physical power. When a character would need to perform a physical feat such as lifting a heavy log, bending prison bars, or swinging a fist, this attribute comes into play.\nDexterity §\nDexterity is the character’s agility, finesse, and ability to flow with a punch or incoming blow. Dexterity also covers fine motor skills like using a lock pick. If a character is needing to hop from stone to stone, or balance on a rope, Dexterity is the key stat.\nConstitution §\nConstitution is a character’s ability to take a blow head on, stomach bad food, or handle being pushed around a bit. Even the biggest, strongest character could be a little daisy who cannot take a hit without Constitution.\nIntelligence §\nIntelligence is how fast a character can learn something, retain new knowledge or recall that knowledge accurately. Intelligence isn’t how smart a character is, but how fast they can learn and retain. Intelligence is highly sought after in arcane circles for casting magic or using mind powers.\nWisdom §\nWisdom is when a character can recall a lesson they learned through their actions that you cannot learn in books or formal learning institutions. Wisdom can be used to perform scouting actions, understand nature, or predict the actions of other beings in their universe. Essence powers are driven by this attribute.\nCharisma §\nCharisma is how comely, enigmatic, or likable a character is. It can also be used to assert a character’s will upon other beings in their universe. Being able to influence others is important to some characters such as when bartering or when lying. Holy powers are driven by this attribute.\nDerived Statistics §\n\nWounds are equal to 8 plus Constitution Ranks for a normal human.\nToughness is equal to 8 plus Strength Ranks for a normal human.\nStrain is equal to 8 plus Wisdom Ranks for a normal human.\n\nSkills §\n\nStart with a 20XP budget to assign to skills.\nSkills start at rank zero to a maximum of five.\nEach rank costs the five times the value of the skill rank.\n\nRank one is five XP, rank two is ten XP.\n\n\nEach rank in a skill adds PD to a character’s check.\n\nSkills are the main way that characters achieve their goals in addition to other boons gained through quality gear or situational modifiers.\nEach Skill has an associated Attribute. These attributes dictate what the target number is for the skill being used.\nSkills have a rank of zero to five. When purchasing ranks in a skill, it costs five times the skill’s rank in XP. This means to go from rank zero to rank one, it costs five XP. Then to go from rank one to rank two, it costs ten XP. To go from rank zero to rank two, the cost would be 15 XP.\nEach rank in a skill adds +1PD to the character’s Positive Dice pool.\nSkills List §\nNOTE:The following skill list should not be considered comprehensive. These are the default skills but new ones can be added per game or genre or setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkill NameLinked AttributeCategoryAthleticsStrengthGeneralManipulationDexterityGeneralMedicineIntelligenceGeneralBrawlStrengthCombatMelee (Light, Heavy)StrengthCombatRanged (Light, Heavy)DexterityCombatGunneryDexterityCombatArcaneIntelligencePowerHolyCharismaPowerEssenceWisdomPowerLeadershipCharismaSocialIntimidationCharismaSocialNegotiationWisdomSocial\nTraits §\nChoose Equipment §\nEquipment §\nArmor §\nWeapons §\nGear §\nEncounters §\nCombat §\nSocial §\nPowers §\nSkill Permissions §\nA Skill or Trait is required in one of these.\nArcane §\nStudied logic of the realm or plane.\nDivine §\nDraw in a deity’s power to yourself.

This does not physically alter the target.\nEvocation §\nDestruction, blasts, and explosions.\nIllusion §\nCreation of visual, auditory, or physical effects that trick the target.\nNecromancy §\nTwo schools of thought. As both deal with life and death, they are part of this category.\n\nHealing, being able to heal others.\nDeath, tamper with life energies of creatures, people or nature around the caster.

He  names his stats Cool (reflexive/graceful), Hot (persuasive/assertive),  Hard (aggressive/forceful), Sharp (calculating/methodical), and Weird  (inquisitive/exploratory).\n\n\nCourtney wants to use Simple World to play a “unicorn-riding ladies  on a quest” game. She names her stats Grace (reflexive/graceful),  Charm (persuasive/assertive), Daring (aggressive/forceful), Cunning  (calculating/methodical), and Whim (inquisitive/exploratory).\n\nWrite the Stats onto each player’s character sheet.\nTake a set of index cards. Write an evocative title on each – a type of  interesting person you’d want to tell stories about. These are the game’s  character seeds. Beneath the title, list three specialities they might excel at.\n\nVx writes Brainer (mind control, echoing the psychic maelstrom,  voyeurism) and Hardholder (controlling lackeys, protecting the  village, bartering up) and Driver (driving cars, acting disinterested,  siege) and Savvyhead (fixing things, breaking things, unlocking the  secrets of the universe).\n\n\nCourtney writes Princess (leading comrades, courage spells, archery)  and Hand-Maiden (supporting comrades, healing spells, subterfuge)  and Witch (vanquishing evil, curses, speaking to ghosts) and HawkCaller (siege tactics, recon, merciless choices).\n\nNext, take a look at your Agenda / Principles / MC Moves.\nAgendas §\nThe Agendas are the reasons you play the game.  The first two are filled in for you. Fill in the third:\n\nMake the players’ characters’ lives not boring.\nPlay to find out what happens.\n\nPrinciples §\nThe Principles are things you should seek to do whenever you speak, in  the game. A list is filled in for you, just waiting to be customized. Use this  customization opportunity to establish the way you plan to pace and run  the game.  Cross off up to two of these Principles, and write in up to two of your own:\n\nSprinkle evocative details everywhere.\nMake the world seem real.\nBuild a bigger world through play.\nCreate interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.\nAddress yourself to the characters, not the players.\nMake your move, but misdirect.\nMake your move, but never speak its name.\nLook at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs.\nName everyone, make everyone human.\nAsk provocative questions and build on the answers.\nRespond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.\nBe a fan of the players’ characters.\nThink offscreen, too.\nSometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.\n\nMC Moves §\nThe MC Moves are the specific things you say in any moment. There  are two different cases where you use the MC Moves, and you use  them differently in each of those cases. When the players look at you  expectantly, you make a regular MC Move. When a player fails a die  roll (getting 6 or lower), you make a hard MC Move. John Harper best  described how to handle those two cases, so I’ll quote him:\nWhen you make a regular MC move, all three:\n\nIt follows logically from the fiction.\nIt gives the player an opportunity to react.\nIt sets you up for a future harder move.\n\nSay what happens but stop before the effect, then ask “What do you do?”\nWhen you make a hard MC move, both:\n\nIt follows logically from the fiction.\nIt’s irrevocable.\n\nSay what happens, including the effect, then ask “What do you do?”\nA list of MC Moves is already written for you, waiting to be customized.\nCross off up to three moves, and add up to three of your own to the list:\n\nSeparate them.\nPut them together.\nPut someone in a high-stakes situation.\nTrade harm for harm (as established).\nDeal harm (as established).\nAnnounce off-screen badness.\nAnnounce future badness.\nTake away one of their Things.\nDemonstrate one of their Things’ bad sides.\nGive them a difficult decision to make.\nTell them the possible consequences and ask.\nTurn their move back on them.\nMake a move from one of your Dangers or Bigger Pictures.\n\n\nVx add “Erode all status quos” as his final Agenda. For Principals, he crosses off “Build a bigger world through play,” as his vision involves small communities and very little over-arching social structure. He also crosses off “Sprinkle evocative details everywhere” in order to replace it with the more specific and thematic “Barf forth apocalyptica.” For the MC Moves, he crosses off “Put them together” and adds “Capture someone” and “Reveal a fundamental scarcity.”\n\n\nCourtney adds “Make doing the right thing difficult for the players’ characters” as her final Agenda. For Principals, she crosses off “Look at your NPCs and ideas through cross-hairs” and writes “Allow your NPCs to change and develop in expected directions.” For MC Moves, she crosses off “Trade harm for harm (as established)” and “Deal harm (as established).” She adds “Introduce a new barrier to carrying on” and “Destroy something precious (as established).”\n\nRelationships §\nFinally, every PC in the game has a relationship stat with every other character. You can name this relationship stat something special, or just call it “Relationships.” When you help someone or hinder them, that has its own basic move, and you roll your relationship stat.\nHelping and Hindering PCs §\nWhen you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with that person. On a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll. On a 7-9, the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.\nHelping and Hindering NPCs §\nWhen you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with that person. On a 10+, they either succeed or fail - your choice. On a 7-9, the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail - your choice.\nAt the start of the game, each player will assign the following relationship stat scores that their character has toward the other PCs: +2 for the one they know best, -1 for the one they know least, and +1 for all others. They will also list “NPCs: 0,” as the default is that they have a relationship score with all NPCs that starts at 0.\nRelationship scores will go up and down over play. Choose how:\n\nAt the end of each session, each player gets to adjust one PC score up or down by1.\nWhenever two characters have a special scene together, their scores go up by 1.  Whenever two characters work against one another publicly, their scores go down by 1.\nCharacters can betray one another for a +2 bonus to a roll, but their relationship score goes down by 1. Characters can make meaningful sacrifices for someone, and their relationship score toward that person will go up by one.\nSome other system that you invent:\n\nWrite the relationship score triggers on each character sheet.\n\nVx names his relationship stat Hx. He decides that at the end of each session, each player gets to adjust one PC score up or down by 1.\n\n\nCourtney names her relationship stat Friendship. She decides to create her own system for how relationships go up. Each PC lists a virtue on their character sheet (Hope, Justice, Bravery, etc). When another PC exemplifies that virtue, the relationship held toward that PC goes up by 1. Whenever another PC contradicts that virtue, the relationship held toward that PC goes down by 1.\n\n\nJoe is writing a Simple World game about teenage monster drama. He decides that the relationship stat goes down every time you roll it, and it goes up every time you gain emotional leverage over a character (NPCs included!).\n\nThat’s it! You’ve got stats, character seeds, Agendas/Principles/Moves, and\na relationship stat. You’re ready to get a group together and play.\nCreating Characters §\nHand each player a character sheet. It should have the stat names listed, including the relationship stat. It should have a description of how the relationship stat goes up and down over the course of the game.\nPlace the character concepts in the middle of the table. Talk about what they might mean and why they might be cool. Have everyone pick one and fasten it to their character sheet (in the concept box) using a paper clip.\nTell them to assign the following numbers to their 5 basic stats: +2, +1, +1, 0, -1. If you only have 4 stats, instead assign: +2, +1, 0, -1.\nThe maximum that a stat can ever reach in the game is +3, and the minimum is -1. This includes relationship stats. Player moves cannot advance a stat beyond +3 (though player moves can temporarily or circumstantially increase it beyond +3).\nEach PC has a relationship stat with each other PC. Tell the players to do this: whichever PC they know the best, write +2 next to that character’s name. Whichever PC they know the least, write -1 next to that character’s name. For each other PC, write +1. Tell them to write “NPCs” and assign that relationship a 0.\nEvery character has a harm clock, with six sections. When characters take harm in the game, they mark a number of sections equal to whatever amount of harm the MC tells them they take. Point out the harm clock, and explain that when it’s filled all the way up, the characters are taken out of the action (in a genre-appropriate way).\nThe next stage of creating characters is to pick 3 moves. When a player picks a move, they pick an option from the list below, give the move a title, and fill in the blanks. Each move gets recorded on their character sheet.\nPlayer Moves §\n\nWhen you do something relating to specialty, add +1.\nYou have the ability to do some sort of active special power. It counts as a basic move using stat.\nYou have some passive special power that has a constant effect.\nYou have a thing. When applicable, it adds +1 to stat and stat.\nWhen you do specialty, mark XP.\nAdd +1 to stat.\n\n\nMark is playing in Vx’s apocalyptic game. He chooses Brainer, and\nnames them Wendigo. He gives Wendigo the stats: Cool -1, Hot 0, Hard\n+1, Sharp +1, Weird +2. Their relationship stat is called Hx, and the\nother PCs are named Brink and Rolfball. He decides he has Hx 2 with\nBlink, and Hx -1 with Rolfball. He creates the following three moves:\n\n\nDirty Secrets: You have the ability to detect someone’s secret shame. It\ncounts as a basic move using Weird.\n\n\nMind Strings: When you do something relating to mind control, add +1.\n\n\nOpen Your Brain: When you echo the psychic maelstrom, mark XP.\n\n\nLane is playing in Courtney’s unicorn knights game. He chooses\nPrincess, and names his character Lucinda. He gives Lucinda the stats:\nGrace +1, Charm +2, Daring 0, Cunning +1, and Whim -1. Their\nrelationship stat is tied to a virtue, and Lane chooses Courage. He\ndecides Lucinda knows Mercury the best, and writes “Mercury +2.” He\ndecides he knows Helena the least, and so has a Relationship of -1 with\nHelena. That leaves Ophelia, who Lucinda has a +1 relationship with\nby default. Lucinda is given the following three player moves:\n\n\nFearless: When you do something related to leading comrades, add +1.\n\n\nSharpshooter: When you do something related to archery, add +1.\n\n\nHorn of Ancestral Power: You have a Horn of Ancestral Power. When\napplicable, it adds +1 to Charm.\n\nFinally, each PC is going to have two stats highlighted. Have each player (except the MC) choose and highlight a stat for the PC to their left. Then have the MC highlight a second stat.\nWhen you highlight a stat, you fill in the bubble next to the stat. When a PC rolls a highlighted stat, they gain a point of XP (experience).\nPlaying the Game §\nMCing the Game §\nEarly in the first session, the MC should juggle two responsibilities:\n\nFollow the PCs around, and learn what they’re all about.\nGive the players a sense of what the world is like, and how it operates.\n\nAstute players will realize that these two things can sometimes be at odds with one another. MC, the way you navigate this combination of responsibilities is by honouring your Agendas and your Principles.\nTalking and Moves §\nThe game is like a conversation. People describe what their characters do, ask questions about what’s going on, and talk in character. If someone says something that seems untrue or unreasonable, the MC is allowed to say, “I don’t think that’s possible, but you could instead make some other interesting choice, if you’d like.”\nAt some point, the MC will determine that something requires a roll. Actions require a roll when they are opposed by other characters or run the risk of interesting failure. When one of these conditions is met, the player needs to roll for a basic move. The MC will name which stat applies to the situation. The player rolls two six-sided dice and adds their stat to the sum. The effects depend on the basic move in question.\nBasic Moves §\nThere are three basic moves.\nTake Action §\nWhen you take an action that risks failure or opposition, roll with one of the basic stats.\n\nOn a 10+, you succeed at your goal. As appropriate, the MC might award you: resource points, harm dealt, or a bonus to carry forward.\nOn a 7-9, the MC will offer you a hard bargain or a cost. If you agree to that hard bargain or cost, you succeed at your goal (and as appropriate, the MC might award you resource points, harm dealt, or a bonus to carry forward).\nOn a 6 or less,\n\nHelping and Hindering PCs §\nWhen you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with that person.\n\nOn a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll.\nOn a 7-9, the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.\nOn a 6 or less,\n\nHelping and Hindering NPCs §\nWhen you help someone or hinder them, roll your relationship stat with that person.\n\nOn a 10+, they either succeed or fail – your choice.\nOn a 7-9, the MC will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail – your choice.\nOn a 6 or less,\n\nScoring a Miss §\nWhen you roll 6 or lower on a Basic Move, the MC gets to make a hard MC Move.\nMoves (both the Basic Moves and the MC Moves) should continually propel the game forward in interesting ways. When a player succeeds on a Basic Move, their success should be interesting and introduce new opportunities for them. When a player gets a 7-9 on a Basic Move, the dilemma and hard bargain should create compelling drama, and either choice should be interesting and take the story in new directions. When a player fails on a Basic Move, the MC should respond with a hard MC Move that fundamentally changes the situation and demands new kinds of action.\nWhenever people look at the MC expectantly, the MC should make a regular MC Move. This should create new things for the players to react to. The MC should then go on to say, “So, what do you do?”\nResource Points §\nWhen someone succeeds (with a 10+ or a 7-9) on a Taking Action roll, it’ll sometimes make sense to represent their success with a number of resource points. For example, if someone tries to read a person’s facial expressions and determine their true intent in a conversation, they might make a roll. If they get a 10+, the MC might determine that they have 3 conversation points, and they can spend those points 1-for-1 to get answers about the character’s motivations and goals during the conversation. Resource points are always given a name and function at the time they are awarded. In most cases, resource points should be temporary, lasting until the end of a scene or situation.\n\nIn Vx’s game, Wendigo (the Brainer) decides to try to mind control a wandering merchant to just hand over his choice goods. The MC says, “Well, that sounds like Taking Action, because the merchant is obviously opposed to such an attempt. Weird applies here, right?” Wendigo’s Weird stat is 2, and he’s got that move Mind Strings (When you do something relating to mind control, add +1). He rolls a 2 and a 5, and adds it to the +3 from his stat &amp; move. A 10! The MC says, “Alright, you’ve got two mind control points. You can spend them 1-for-1 to force him to either obey a psychic command or suffer 1 harm.”\n\n\nIn Courtney’s game, Lucinda (the Princess) decides to lead her fellow unicorn knights on a charge into the ogre’s keep! She’s unfortunately got a Daring of 0, but she has a move that applies: Fearless (When you do something related to leading comrades, add +1). She rolls a total of 7. The MC says, “Alright, here’s your hard bargain: as you’re charging in, the ogre sentries ready their spiked clubs. You can press forward, but your unicorn will be wounded and require care.” Lucinda agrees, and the MC says, “Alright, I’m going to award you three tactics points. You can spend them to do stuff like: round up the sentries, ensure no ogres escape, ensure no one else gets wounded, avoid being smoked out or driven back, ask questions about the situation, and so on.”\n\nDealing Harm §\nWhen someone succeeds on a Taking Action roll, it’ll sometimes make sense that they would deal harm to their opposition. Harm is typically physical harm that’s brought about by violence, but it may vary from setting to setting. When someone does harm to someone else, the MC will rate that harm from 1-3. What qualifies as a certain score will vary from setting to setting. PC harm gets marked down on the harm clock on their character sheet. NPC harm gets noted by the MC, either in their head or on a notes page. NPCs can typically take 2 harm before they’re taken out of the action, but tougher NPCs might have more.\nBeing Taken Out of Action §\nWhen a character has all of their harm sections filled in, they’re taken out of the action. The specifics will vary based on genre and context. In a Hardy Boys game, being taken out of the action means disappearing under mysterious circumstances (to wake up tied to a chair later) or being put into a coma. In an apocalyptic gang fighting game, being taken out of the action means being killed. When a character is taken out of the action, they’re no longer playable – either they’re dead or they’re the functional equivalent of being dead. If the character was a PC, the player should create a new character.\n\nIn Vx’s game, Brink (the Driver) decides to run over a thug who’s trying to guard the road. He rolls Hard, and gets a 10. The MC says, “Great. You definitely hit this guy and hear a thump underneath the car. A car going at this speed is definitely worth 2 harm, so he’s either dead or near death. The road’s clear. What do you do next?\n\nBonus to Carry Forward §\nSometimes, succeeding on a Taking Action roll means that the PC is set up for future successes. In these cases, the MC can award a +1 bonus that the PC can apply to their next roll. The player should mark that bonus on their character sheet.\n\nIn Courtney’s game, Helena (the Hawk Caller) sends her hawks out to scout for the best place to try to sneak across the fortress walls. That’s a Taking Action roll, and Helena gets a 7-9. The MC says, “Alright, your hawks sweep over the fortress, but they draw the suspicions of the guards. If you press forward, you’ll be encountering guards who are armed and ready for you. But the hawks do identify the best place for you to try to scale the walls – down by the thicket, where the wall has begun to crumble. You’ll carry a +1 bonus forward to scaling the wall there, if you choose to.”\n\nMarking XP §\nWhenever you roll a highlighted stat you earn a point of XP. Mark it on the XP section of your sheet. When you hit 5 XP, erase all of it and take a new Player Move. If you’ve already got at least one move that references each of your specialities, you may create a new specialty and reference it in the Player Move you purchase.\nBetween Sessions §\nAt the end of each session, players may be asked to adjust relationship stats (if that’s how relationship stats fluctuate in your game). Between sessions, the MC might create Dangers, and might link those Dangers into Bigger Pictures. At the start of each session, highlighted stats are changed. Whoever has the highest relationship score with a character chooses a stat to highlight, and the MC highlights a second stat.\nDangers and the Bigger Picture §\nBetween sessions, or even during them, the MC can create Dangers. Dangers are things that might cause problems for the PCs, or fight them for resources, or block the PCs on their path. When you create a Danger, take an index card. Write its name, and its Ambition, and 1-3 MC Moves.\nIts Ambition is whatever this thing wants and strives for. If the PCs don’t do anything about the Danger, the Ambition will either happen or it’ll be attempted and disastrous effects will result. The MC Moves are things that the MC can add to their list of MC Moves whenever the Danger is afoot.\n\nIn Vx’s post-apocalyptic game, he creates a Danger called “Morken, the Grotesque.” His Ambition is “Hoard all valuables in the rag wastes.” His MC Moves are “Display the nature of the world it inhabits. Threaten someone, directly or by implication. Steal something from someone.” Whenever Morken is in the scene, those three things are things that Vx can do as MC Moves.\n\n\nIn Courtney’s unicorn knights game, she creates a Danger called “The Swamps of Symmetry.” Its Ambition is “Eliminate all odd numbers and out-of-balance things.” Its MC Moves are “Corral people into a remote location. Obscure the way out. Attempt to swallow people alive.”\n\nIf you have a group of Dangers that work together or interlock, you can group them together into a Bigger Picture. Take an index card and fold it in half. Now it acts as a folder or hand that you can stick the related Dangers into. On the front of the folded index card, list the Bigger Picture’s name. On the inside halves, list a new Principle and a Dark Future. The Principle is something that you should do whenever this Bigger Picture is involved in a scene. The Dark Future is a list of possibilities for what could happen if the PCs don’t intervene and change this Bigger Picture.\n\nVx decides that Morken isn’t the only threat in the Rag Wastes. So he creates a new Bigger Picture called “The Rag Wastes.” In it, Vx sticks three interrelated Dangers: Morken the Grotesque; The Gang of Thunder; Rag Wurms. He lists a new Principle for whenever the PCs are interacting with the Rag Wastes: “Entice people with dangerous opportunities.” As the Dark Future, Vx writes “The Rag Wastes will expand, becoming a dangerous and impassible realm of thieves and mutants.”\n\n\nGenre and MC Decisions §\nThe MC will have to make a number of decisions before and during play. The MC Prep that comes before play (naming stats, modifying Agendas/Principles/MC Moves, clarifying the relationship stat) involves a lot of decisions about genre and tone. More decisions along these lines will be made in play.\nThe MC will have to make judgment calls about what requires a Taking Action roll, and what is outright impossible in the genre. The MC should use their veto right judiciously and sparingly. If someone wants to take an action that subverts the genre, that’s good! It’s only when they want to take an action that is impossible or nonsensical for a given genre that the MC should say that something isn’t possible. When the MC says this, they should use the line, “I don’t think that’s possible, but you could instead make some other interesting choice, if you’d like.”\nWhen someone has all of the sections on their harm clock filled in, they are taken out of the action. What this means is dependent on genre and context. In a fighting adventure game, this will typically mean that they are killed or captured by fierce antagonistic forces. The MC should not pull their punches when they take someone out of the action! It should be done in the most dramatic and severe and permanent manner that makes sense for the genre and context.\nSheets §\nMaster of Ceremonies Prep Sheet §\n\nPlayer Character Record Sheet §\n"},"Solo-Games/Assassin's-Creed-of-Duskvol---BitD/Play/AC-Blades-Mystery-Matrix":{"title":"AC Blades Mystery Matrix","links":["z_Attachments/Pasted-Image-20230103113101_563.png"],"tags":["excalidraw"],"content":"⚠  Switch to EXCALIDRAW VIEW in the MORE OPTIONS menu of this document. ⚠\nText Elements §\nFind the first Templar identity \nFagreed\nTarjen \nPrivah\nSegah \nMerchant Cartel\nincreasing prices \n1 \n2 \n2 \nSparkwright\nOfficer \nSparkwright pin \n2 \nChurch of Ecstasy\nCleric \nChurch Ring in\nPossession of templars \n1 \nColfer\nWithers \n1 \nGhost repelling device\nWith Templar symbol \nEmbedded files §\n2434a3da35fca3b86e3ae78e49c01948148f1d9d: Pasted Image 20230103113101_563.png"},"Solo-Games/Assassin's-Creed-of-Duskvol---BitD/Play/Blades-Mythic-Lists":{"title":"Blades Mythic Lists","links":["z_Attachments/Pasted-image-20230114180709.png"],"tags":["excalidraw"],"content":"⚠  Switch to EXCALIDRAW VIEW in the MORE OPTIONS menu of this document. ⚠\nText Elements §\nFind the first Templar \nGrow influence in city \nInvestigate Rotting Ghosts \nFind Colfer Withers \nAssassins \nChurch of Ecstasy \nAssassins \nColfer Withers \nCrow’s Foot \nDarmot \nFringe Factions \nGangs \nHouse Sgah \nHouse Tarjen \nIstitutions \nPCs \nLabor Guilds \nSevoy \nTelda \nTemplars \nSevoy \nTemplars \nEmbedded files §\n73a41c98b2e50afed2fbb45c2285f7d4e5edd68c: Pasted image 20230114180709.png"},"Solo-Games/Assassin's-Creed-of-Duskvol---BitD/Play/Character-Sheet":{"title":"Character Sheet","links":["z_Attachments/Pasted-Image-20230718180347_884.png","z_Attachments/Pasted-Image-20230718180832_111.png","z_Attachments/Pasted-Image-20230805231238_180.png"],"tags":["excalidraw"],"content":"⚠  Switch to EXCALIDRAW VIEW in the MORE OPTIONS menu of this document. ⚠\nText Elements §\nAssassins \nKonrad Ustifer \nShadow \nSlim and fast, short dark hairs, serious \nBackground: Carpenter \nVice: Obligation towards his family, keeping them fed \nAssassins \nSubtle \nCrow’s Foot, behind a blacksmith shop \nThe Foundation +1 status \nBluecoats -1 status \nSparkwrights, +1 \nHunting Ground: Chartedhall, City Council -1 \nThe Red Sashes, -1 \nGustav Morris \nAsassins \nDead Eyes \nBig and muscular, pitch-black eyes, angry look \nDischarged with dishonour from the military,\nGustav always says he was “the most honourable among those pigs”, without elaborating \nChael was an ex comrade in the military \nSawtooth healed him back up too many times \nVice: Stupor, he fights in the fighting pits to feel numb, for once. \nBurned hand \nPortable ghost repellant \nEmbedded files §\n7424bce4cebca789114e8c4a419c1117957fdf95: Pasted Image 20230718180347_884.png\n0e1b51d39e4bdefe9d4d6309280c028c58f2bb96: Pasted Image 20230718180832_111.png\n5b19a12238bdf24dd7be31e9d75ce21884e94648: Pasted Image 20230805231238_180.png"},"Solo-Games/Assassin's-Creed-of-Duskvol---BitD/Play/Interactive-Doskvol-map":{"title":"Interactive Doskvol map","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"https://view.genial.ly/6049f0146b43db0db4e4d02d/interactive-image-doskvol-map-with-districts"},"Solo-Games/Assassin's-Creed-of-Duskvol---BitD/Play/Intro-to-D&D-players":{"title":"Intro to D&D players","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"From https://www.reddit.com/r/bladesinthedark/comments/ptiry0/what_do_you_think_are_some_of_the_key_differences/\nI’d try not to overwhelm them with info-dumps unless they ask about stuff. The games are totally different, so I’d probably just make two main bullets (since they can remember two), then go over specific differences when they’re coming up:\n\n\nD&amp;D is a game that is fundamentally built around combat. Your character class is mostly about combat abilities. This isn’t D&amp;D. BitD is about daring scoundrels. Combat exists, but combat isn’t the focus, so don’t think of it as the focus. Sneaking, social intrigue, and doing weird magic shit are all equally viable as combat so don’t focus on making a combat character.\n\n\n(Depending on the game you last played, YMMV) D&amp;D is a game about heroic fantasy. This isn’t D&amp;D. BitD is about being scoundrels, and scoundrels are underdogs. You’re going to lose sometimes. You’re going to get bloody sometimes. You probably wont die, but your character will probably stress the fuck out. Life as a scoundrel isn’t easy. This isn’t a power fantasy.\n\n\nThen I’d repeat: so, BitD is about daring scoundrels, and scoundrels are underdogs … Lets talk about what kind of scoundrels you want to be. Lets look at the options for crews, which are basically “the party”. So, what do you want your crew to be? what kinds of jobs do you want to take on?…\nThen I’d help them pick a crew, then start talking about individual characters.\nWhen talking about making characters:\n\n\nThis is not D&amp;D. There are no attack rolls and no AC, and no skill-checks either. Action rolls take care of all of that. The die-pool system means that the distribution of results are a lot more predictable (compared to the swingy d20 in D&amp;D). There is no roll where “nothing happens” (unlike D&amp;D where if you swing and miss, nothing happens). The most common outcome of a roll is “mixed success”, which means you get what you want but you also get something you don’t want. Don’t let this feel like failure. That’s life because scoundrels are underdogs.\n\n\nD&amp;D can be played where you follow the rules (nearly) to the letter. In contrast, BitD has many places where you’re meant to take the text as an example, not as a fact. For example, each character has access to a list of standard items, but think of that list as examples: stay within the theme, but feel free to be creative. You might carry an item that is not exactly what is written down, but that is similar to something on the list, and that’s encouraged.\n\n\nYour low-level characters are not as weak as lvl 1 D&amp;D characters, but your high-level characters are not as unstoppable as lvl 10 D&amp;D characters. Even your first character is a daring scoundrel, but even the greatest scoundrel is an underdog.\n\n\nLevelling works very differently. Rather than getting a predetermined list of advances when you level, you get to pick and choose. You also level Action ratings separately from picking new Special Abilities. There are 4 XP tracks (then point them out on the sheet). Plus, you don’t get XP for killing things or getting loot. You get XP for the way you roleplay and what your character does in the world (point to the section on the sheet). So, in addition to being a daring scoundrel, your character might focus on solving problems with X or Y, or A or B…\n\n\nThe HP system is totally different. It is hard to outright die in BitD, but you suffer negative effects from harm long before you are unconscious (as opposed to 1 HP being just as effective as 100 HP in D&amp;D).\n\n\nidk, that’s some stuff.\nI’d also tell them to read the Players Best Practices section for sure for sure for sure. That’s gold. Something like that should be in every TTRPG book.\nAlso from https://www.reddit.com/r/bladesinthedark/comments/11hm62d/making_introductions_whats_the_best_way_to_start/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=14&amp;utm_content=share_button\n\n\nChoose Crew Type.

Both are in Chartedhall neighbourhood.\nType: Stealth\nDetail: Infiltration mode → Entering from the canals under the house.\nLoad: light\nKonrad goes to first house, House Segah.\nLet’s ready an Alarm Clock for the house, 8 segments. 0/8\n\nEngagement roll: 1d base + low security 1d. Roll: 5, 4. Mixed. Risky position when action start.\n\nKonrad arrives with a small gondola under the house, finding a small trapdoor used to discard refuses into the black water under it.\nHe reaches to the opening, opens the small wooden door and finds himself in a small room, with dirty crates full of refuses, a bad smell of rotting food and a burly guard, smoking while on duty. A door leads out of the room, but Konrad does some noise when closing the trapdoor behind him, attracting the guard’s attention.\n\nKonrad tries to HUNT the guard, leaping from his cover and killing with his hidden blade. HUNT is 2, Risky position, standard effect. 2d= 2, 3. 3 total. Failure. No effect plus a consequence. I say I end up in a worse position. 1XP for stealth roll.\n\nThe guard manages to block the arm, avoiding the blow and pushing Konrad to the ground. After that, he unsheathe his sword and tries to hit back.\n\nSKIRMISH, desperate position, standard effect. 0, so 2d6 with disadvantagee. 3, 5 = 3, failure. I need to resist it with a resistance roll. 3 PROWESS, so 5, 5, 6. 6 stress - 6 = 0. Nice. +1 XP desperate roll. 1XP desperate action.\n\nWith that, Konrad rolls away and gets up, going again for the kill with the blade.\n\nI say FINESSE here because he is more in control, Risky position, Standard effect. 2, failure. I resist it again. 6, 6, 4. Critical, I would clear 1 stress if I had any. Since it’s a critical and the fight is holding up too much: Konrad dodges another sword attack and pushes the hidden blade into the throat of the guard.\n\nAfter disposing of the body in the trapdoor, he continues after the door.\nNow that I think of it, I forgot to add +1d on the first strike for the Ambush ability of Konrad…\nScene 2 §\nThe combat went worse than expected, CF is 6.\nExpected scene: Explore location and search for Templar connections.\nTest: 9. Expected.\n\nWhat do I find in the merchant house?\nDomicile Table: Storage, Animal.\nSome sort of personal zoo for an extravagant merchant.\nFQ: Are there any guards? 50/50. 13. Yes.\n\nSome guards are patrolling what seems to be a large room with cages filled with exotic animals of many spacies.\nKonrad tries to go past them, searching for some good intel in the merchant office, here somewhere.\n\nIt’s a PROWL roll. Risky/Standard. 1, 1. Failure. Consequence is a complication, going to Desperate position.\n\nWhile skulking in the shadows, Konrad passes near a bird cage, alerting the animal that starts making noise. A couple of guards starts to look around, one going towards the cage. Konrad tries to distract the guards by opening the cage.\n\nA FINESSE roll, being more related to a dexterity instead of TINKER. Desperate/Great, since the precious bird would be important to recuperate, so the effect would lead to a better situation. 1d for FINESSE. 5.\nI do it, but I take a lesser effect instead. 1XP desperate action.\n\nThe bird flies out of the cage, losing some feathers in its mad dash for freedom. One of the guards ignores everything trying to go after it, while the other tries to look at the cage instead.\nKonrad tries to ambush him when he gets close enough.\n\nHUNT roll. 2d +1d for Ambush ability. Still Desperate/Standard. 1, 1, 4. I do it but suffer a complication. I would increase the alert clock, but another guard is here already. +2 XP. Desperate stealth roll. 1XP desperate action.\n\nKonrad kills him, but doesn’t manage to keep the body upright, knocking over the empty cage. Other animals are alerted, getting the attention of the other guard, which charges the assassin.\n\nSKIRMISH roll. 0d, so disadvantage. Risky/Standard since Konrad has time to recover a bit for the charge. 1. I go to desperate position.\n\nKonrad is knocked over by the shoulder charge of the guard.\n\nSKIRMISH again. Desperate/Standard. 2. I lose the opportunity, but I resist it. 6 highest on Prowess, so 0 stress. Phew. 1XP desperate action.\n\nWhile being knocked over, he notices the guard trying to run to another door to sound the alarm. Konrad manages to trip him by grabbing his foot. The guard drops down face first, a pool of blood starts to form around the head, he’s not moving.\nKonrad leaves the bird flying around and moves the bodies in a corner. The blood is not easy to clean, no point in hiding the bodies too much.\nScene 3 §\nCF: 7, not in control at all.\nExpected Scene: Search for the office room first, for Templar connections.\nTest: 4. Interrupt, NPC Action.\nRolled Sevoy, the merchant lord that is a contact for the Assassins.\nCharacter Action, General table: Imitate, Aggressive.\nSince there is no reason for another merchant to enter inside another merchant house in the middle of the night, I’ll consider the interrupt scene as a kind of heavily altered scene instead.\nKonrad finds the office room. A finely detailed baroque room with golden details everywhere, stuffed animals dotting corners.\nEasily findable, on the main desk, are numerous letters exchanged between Privah Segah, head of House Segah and Sevoy. In there, a negotiation goes on, in which Sevoy tries to make thinly threats of retorsion if a job is not carried out at the previously agreed rate. From the answer, the threat didn’t land.\nKonrad tries to search in a more in depth way the room for correspondance and contracts.\n\nSURVEY roll. 1d. Controlled/Standard. Devil’s Bargain to leave traces conducting to the Assassins in the room, giving me +1 Heat after the score for +1d now. 1, 2. Fail. I resist. Insight, 3 dots. 3, 4, 6. 0 Stress. I ignore the risky opportunity from a failed controlled roll.\n\nSince I should be able to find something if it’s present, I can do a Mystery Matrix Discovery Check.\nFQ: Is anything found?

Take 2 stress but no harm.\n\nAfter fighting with him, trading punches while Konrad manages to keep his mouth shut, he finally manages to push his head in the putrid water of the WC, keeping him under until he is no more.\nAfter the ordeal, he quickly cut him with the blade dirtying a feather in his blood, a ritual sign of the Assassins of a finished job.\nKonrad then pats him in search of other possible informations.\n\nFQ: Is something found? 50/50. 14.

No need for even more ghosts while sneaking around.\nThe tall stone and timber building had some glasswork on the windows, which now lie shattered on the ground. A hole in a wall seems to be where the explosion happened.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nFQ: Is there an Horror near the entrance? 50/50. 7, 4. 9.

No with Random event!\nEvent Focus table: 7. Ambiguous Event.\nDescription table: Anxiously Soft\nAction table: Easy Individual\n\nNot people, there should be plenty of electroplasmic fuel in here, which is flammable and liquid. Quite anxiety inducing soft matter.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nFQ: Is there a ghost? Likely. 2, 5. 6. No.\n\nThe room where the explosion came from seems to be the warehouse where the fuel was stored. A big hole testifies that a good chunk of it has blown up. A lot of fuel is still there however, thanks to the sturdy containers (think of the fuel glass containers from the videogame Dishonored) and a fire is ongoing.\nGustav and Konrad try to stop the fire from blowing the tower up definitely. After they will try to reactivate the tower, then resume the search for Colfer.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nGroup TINKER action. Risky/Standard.\nKonrad: Tinker 0. 5, 4. 4.\nGustav: Tinker 0. 1, 2. 1.\nGroup: 4\nDo it, but consequence. Gustav suffers harm.\n\nWhile trying to douse the fire, Gustav holds a hot piece of metal and gets his hand burned. After a few minutes, the fire is isolated from the fuel, giving some respite to the duo.\nImmediately after, they investigate the damage to the mechanism, hoping to be able to restart the protective field.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nGroup SURVEY to assess the situation.\nRisky/Great, since it will inform the next TINKER rolls.\nKonrad: Survey 1. 1.\nGustav: Survey 1. 1. O.O\nKonrad resists. 3d6. 6, 6, 6. Critical! Clear 1 stress (already at 0). Resisted.\nSo it goes badly but no consequences.\nFQ: “Is the situation of the tower bad?” Nearly Certain.  7, 5. 14. Yes.\n\nWhile looking at the machine burning electroplasmic fuel to generate the protective field, they notice that most of the burnable parts are badly damaged. The machine needs new parts to restart, so nothing can be done quickly.\nInstead of searching for possible parts, they decide to quickly survey the area and GTFO, before any Horror can arrive.\nSpeaking of which…\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nFQ: “Does an Horror appears after this time?” Likely. 5, 3. 7. No.\n\nLucky…\nSo the assassins try to search for any clues of Colfer.\nSince they already crossed some obstacles, I will consider the Discovery Check earned.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nFQ: “Is anything discovered?” Almost Certain. 7, 4. 11. Yes.\nMystery Elements Table for Clues: 9. Link Clue to Suspect or New Clue.\nSince the only clue not connected is “Merchant Cartel increasing prices” and I can’t see a connection, I’ll roll a new one.\nClue Descriptor table: Heavy Academic.\nRoll again for inspiration: Cold Frightening\n\nI think they find among the salvaged objects, a device usable to create a small localized Ghost repellant area around the user. Looks to be a new prototype device and has a small tank for fuel.\nActivating it is easy, since there is a button. During operation, the device becomes extremely cold, requiring some protection when handling.\nOne thing they notice is a small Templar symbol and the name C. Withers attached to it.\nI guess we have a new Suspect and the Clue is connected to him.\nAfter retrieving this, they go away from the tower, hearing the shouts of people coming to close the protective gap.\nWill choose where they go next session!\nNew scene as well."},"Solo-Games/Assassin's-Creed-of-Duskvol---BitD/Session-7":{"title":"Session 7","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"For this session, instead of Fate Questions, I will use the light Oracle from our own @Phil https://forums.runehammer.online/t/d6-oracle-and-flavor-roll-table/8937\nYou roll 2d6, 1 is for the oracle, the other for flavor.

Expected.\nWhat do they see?\nLocation tables: Remote-ly Quiet\nAgain for more detail: Official-ly Artistic\n\nSo, the Radiant Farms of Doskvol are mainly serviced by prisoners iirc. I would say that the place they run into is some sort of communal area enclosed with walls to better keep them under control during lunch time. It’s also well illuminated by torches and the walls have been improved by prisoners with various murales, depicting Leviathan’s hunting (the blood of these demonic whales is the base for the electroplasmic fuel) in the pitch-black sea, some Horrors and other places of the archipelago. Pretty dark and not very colorful in general.\nNo one is here at the moment. But what about Colfer?\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nQ: Is Colfer here? Likely. Yes/Really Bad.\nCharacter Actions, General: Threatening Generous\nNeed more: Action table: Arrive Comfort.\n\nWhile they look around for any signs of Colfer, they get distracted by the murales and their numerous eyes seemingly observing them.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nQ: Is Colfer alone? Small Chance. 1. 2. No/Really Bad.\nArmy Descriptor: Active-ly Calm.\n\nWhile distracted, they are suddenly illuminated by a lamp and blinded for a moment, while a laughing voice is heard.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nCharacter Conversation: Businness Enthusiastic\nSince I want to try something else, I’ll use the PDF NPC Creator and Emulator by Eric Bright, which also provides a PDF with generators to automate his tables.\nNPC Conversation, normally Negative towards PCs: Excited\nTopic: The acquisition of knowledge\n\nThe voice of Colfer boasts for finding a couple of Assassins in such an easy way.\nAfter the blindness subsides, both see that Colfer is accompanied by a rather large group of thugs, around 10.\nHe continues talking, speaking about how brute Assassins can’t possibly comprehend what it means to do research with electroplasmic energy and the endless possibilities in manipulating even the souls, and minds, of the living. To grant peace and order where chaos would reign due to the individual.\nSaid that, he orders the thugs to capture them, they will serve as good source of information on the Brotherhood.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nNow, Konrad will try a flashback.\nHe has infiltrated a corrupted thug in the farms ahead of the score, and he is currently manning the lamp. Turning it off will give them a moment to flee.\nSince this was an unlikey opportunity, I say 1 Stress will be needed.\nGustav instead will try to charge at Colfer in the moment, knock him out and run with him away, while Konrad helps him with a Setup.\nKonrad will use the sudden darkness to Ambush with HUNT. Desperate/Standard. 6, 5, 3. 6. He does it.\nGustav will receive improved position from his help. He will do a SKIRMISH with Risky/Standard. 2, 2. Things go badly. End up in desperate position.\n\nAs soon as the lamp goes dark, Konrad kills a thug near Colfer with his blade, creating an opening.\nThis is not enough though, as another thug intercepts Gustav, interrupting his momentum and giving the group a moment to react.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nGustav tries to dispatch the thug and reach Colfer.\nKonrad assists, giving 1d extra. (forgot it the previous roll, better assist than setup)\nSKIRMISH Desperate/Standard. 2, 4, 6. He does it.\n\nAfter dodging a… Blade in the dark from the thug (eheh), a throwing knife from Konrad goes straight for his throat, starting a fountain of blood while he holds the wound trying to breathe.\nGustav downs his armored fist on Colfer’s face, knocking him out and putting him on his shoulder, while both flee away from the remaining thugs and the corrupted one turns on the lamp, to fake a malfunction and save his ass.\nHas anyone said chase time? :D"},"Solo-Games/Cursed-Kingdom-Playtest/Design-notes":{"title":"Design notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"To laboratories:\n\n

Check and Tricube Tales.\nFirst Scene: §\nScene: You meet with Wolf at the Village, he has a nearby mission for you with another new arrival. Explore the nearby Field for a Residuum object.\nCF: 5\nWho I find with the Wolf?\nMeaning Tables:\n\nName: Ganke\nAppearence: Familiar, Hairy → A big guy, with an ample chest and long dark beard. Not very well kept, dishorderly look.\nDescriptors: Peace, Assist → He prefers to keep himself out of bigger troubles, trying to get by with smaller and better known Wild Magic Fields.\nChar Skills: Guide, Environment → He is a tracker and knows well the surroundings of the Village.\n\nI ask The Wolf for indications regarding the Wild Magic Field and the Residuum needed. Also, the reward.\nThe Field:\n\nCurses: Ruin, Intellect → This Field is generally taxing on the mind. Anomalies inside can fry the mind of a victim, turning it into a shambling and violent husk.\nFQ: “Is it in the wilderness?” 12 → Yes, it’s a few hours of travel from the Village.\n\nResiduum needed:\n\nMagic Item Descr: Senses, Death → A type of Residuum that helps in identifying undeads from a good distance.\nFQ: “Is it a common Residuum?” Likely. 10 → No, it’s uncommon but not too rare. There is a quick need for it due to another expert group dealing with undeads, that’s why they will send novice Seekers to search for them quickly.\n\nReward:\nSince it’s a bigger job than usual, it’s going to be around 100 gp for each piece.\nTo find them in the Field, I need to search for lights in there and disturbing them with something to let them materialize In the Material Plane.\nWe are ready and go there, we will arrive late afternoon.\nScene 2 §\nCF: 4. Always in control, nothing happened.\nExpected Scene: We travel in the wilderness, going at normal pace and keeping an eye out.\nTest: 10. Go as expected.\nFQ”Is an Emission happening?” 8. No. Counter +1.\nI try to know better Ganke, chatting a bit.\nCharacter Conversations: Enthusiastic, Inform. → After a bit of small talk, he starts to open up, revealing a chatty person behind the initial stiffness. He starts to talk about his past and how he became a Seeker a couple months ago. He has a bit of training with the bow, he was a hunter, so travelling the wilderness is his specialty. He now knows most of the immediate sorroudings of the Village, while providing for his family, a few days from the border of the Cursed Kingdom.\nWe arrive at the Field late afternoon under the never changing cloudy weather.\nScene 3 §\nCF: 3. In control.\nExpected Scene: We explore the Field searching for Residuum until night comes, then we camp for the night.\nHow are the Field surroundings?\nWe know it’s outdoor wilderness, and shatters the mind.\nFQ: “Is it a swampy area?” 50/50. 5, 5 → 8. No. No Random Event.\nFQ: “is it a forested area?” Likely. 10, 10 → 19. Excep Yes.\nIt’s a very old forest, with a long history.\nForest Descriptors: Lake, Assist → The forest revolevs around a lake, surrounded by the forest. Ganke says that the lake has been lost for years due to the Field. Getting lost inside here is easy due to the mind attacks, so most stay in sight view of the forest border, or use some ropes to be dragged out by companions.\nWe will approach it in the former way.\nWe will explore it for as long as possible. To the default Wild Magic Field, I added Contorted Tree, Ruin, Cave and Lake to the Locations list. The rest is default. Mind Shatter Field.\nBefore entering, I prepare myself mentally, casting a ritualistic spell to fortify our minds. I spend 1 karma for it. All mental attacks will be 1 step easier for a few hours.\nStart of exploration, I will use the Concluding, Short table:\nArea 1:\nLocation: 3 → None or Expected.\nEncounters: 3 → None or Expected. None.\nObjects: 9 → Random. Object Descriptors table: Harmful, Majestic. Dungeon Traps table: Could, Projectile.\nInterpretation:\nOnce entered the tree line, nothing looks too unfamiliar from any other forest. After a few steps, whispers start to be heard. Initially very faint, when entering more in the forest, they become more and more intelligible. While walking, we get near a mutated plant that is ready to shoot a cloud of irritant spores as self defense.\nFirst, mind attack challenge.\nIt’s a easy challenge for now, difficulty 4. Due to my magic, it’s difficulty 3.\nIt’s a crafty challenge, so I roll 2d6. 3, 2. Success.\nNormal crafty challenge to see the trap, difficulty 5. Roll: 5, 4. Success.\nYuhdel sees the plant and Ganke recognizes it, keeping its distance to avoid triggering it.\nThe exploration continues.\nSession 2 §\nThe exploration continues.\nArea 2:\nLocation: 3 → None or Expected. → Expected. lots of trees.\nEncounters: 6 → Expected. → Some small mutated wildlife, nothing aggressive.\nObjects: 2 → None or Expected. → Expected, trees?\nInterpretation:\nAfter the encounter with the dangerous plant, the due continues searching for signs of Residuum.\nGanke continues to throw small pebbles in front of him.\n“Always look out for anomalies here. If you see some visual distortions, throw a pebble at it. If you don’t see it, throw a pebble at it anyway and thank me later. If it has eyes and watches you, throw a bigger pebble, maybe with a stick attached to it and using a bow” he smirks.\nIn the meantime some small two-headed rodents with a sickly look and missing fur run away from us.\nArea 3:\nLocation: 9 → Random. → Locations table: Portal, Intriguing.\nEncounters: 4 → None or Expected.\nObjects: 5 → None or Expected.\nWell, Intriguing Portal. That’s intriguing. I’m picturing some physical entrance to somewhere, not a magic portal, which would be a too powerful magic to remain stable here. Looks like a Scene change to me as well.\nScene Bookkeeping:\nNo Thread changes, no Characters changes for now.\nScene 4 §\nCF: 4. We were in control, but this ending throw it all out the window.\nExpected Scene: We explore this entrance and try to explore it if needed.\nTest: 4. Interrupt!\nEvent Focus: 52, Move Towards a Thread.\nRoll on Thread list: 1. Reach nearby Field and explore it, which I will rename to “Explore the Mind Shatter Field” since I already reached it.\nMmm not sure, it doesn’t feel like an interrupt since I’m already moving towards that thread. I’ll reroll the random event.\nEvent Focus: 21. NPC Action. Roll 10, empty, so I choose. I reroll since I’m undecided, 8. Ganke.  Character Actions, General table: Oppose, Helpful. Nothing good…\nSince the Interrupt didn’t change much of the location, I’ll keep the Portal idea.\nInterpretation:\nWhile walking in the forest and continuing to chat with Ganke to keep the voices out, we come across a circular entrance in the side of a hill.\nFQ: “Is it a Ruined Magical Laboratory?” (from the CK setting) Likely. 9, 3. 12 total. Yes.\nFQ: “Is it already unsealed?” Likely, we are near the Village, so plenty of people have tried. 7, 6. 13 total. Yes.\nAfter seeing this, Ganke stops responding and stops launching pebbles. Without saying a word, he goes straight inside the entrance, eyes fixated in front of him, which has the heavy metal door slightly open to allow a person to pass through.\n“Ganke! What the hell are you doing? Ganke!” I try to whisper as high as possible, the creepiness of the silent forest intimidating.\nSession 3 §\nSince I will follow Ganke inside, I will generate a new Scene for each location.\nFirst though, let’s generate this unsealed Magical Laboratory. I expect for the original research focus of this to maybe still be there, but I expect to find other wildlife too.\nSince this laboratory is inside a forest and inside a Field, I will roll on the Curses (effects of the Field on the Laboratory), Powers (for the original research focus) and Locations tables (for the inside description), maybe something will come out.\nCurses: Neglect, Harm.\nLocations: Fortunate, Charming.\nPowers: Electricity, Emission\nInterpretation:\nThis laboratory was focused on researching the magical links between magic and electricity. The complex itself will be good looking and still in good shape, with some sections still in good working order.\nThe Curse has probably un-stabilized anything magical inside, which could cause harm. Also, the effects of the Mind Shatter Field are not felt inside for some reason (!).\nAlso, since this is the end of the Scene, bookkeeping.\nI will add “Get out with Ganke from the lab” to the Threads list.\nAlso the lab will be added to the Characters list. I expect a short detour, so no new list for this place, yet.\nScene 5 §\nCF: 5. Lost control, so we increase.\nExpected Scene: I enter the laboratory stealthly to avoid attracting undue attention, searching for Ganke.\nTest: 3. Altered! Let’s roll on the Scene Adjustment table to be surprised. 10. Roll 2 adjustments! 6, 2. Add an Object, Add a Character.\nLet’s roll on the Object table: Meaningful, New. So this could be an important object recently arrived here. Something meaningful to Ganke probably has been dropped.\nThe most probable Character here is Ganke itself, but I would say that another Seeker is here instead, from the Seekers entry.\nOk, now for the laboratory itself.\nI will use the standard EC table as is, only adding Seekers to the Encounters table, since it seems that there are more of them. It’s going to be a Concluding, Short location.\nHere is the table:\n\nArea 1:\nLocations: 2: None or Expected. Expected. → An old entrance hall with traces of leaves and dirt coming from outside, brought by animals.\nEncounters: 7: Expected. → The Seeker(s) with the meaningful object.\nObjects: 1: None or Expected. The meaningful object.\nFQ: “Are there 2 or less Seekers?” Likely. 6, 4. 11 total. Yes. 2 Seekers are there.\nCharacters table: Calm, Thieving.\nWhen entering inside the structure, I see this old entrance hall, no windows but still illuminated by the door opening. It’s now quite dirty from contaminations from the outside forest. After entering inside, the whispers suddenly stop and I feel the physic pressure disappearing.\nThe hall is basically empty, with some old broken furniture all over the place. Among those, 2 Seekers are relaxing while looking at some objects in a sack.  They are discussing the value of a necklace, which I recognize as the one Ganke was wearing, a family heirloom he told to me before.\nI try to approach stealthily to hear what they say.\nAgile challenge 5. I roll 2d6. 3, 2. Fail.\nWhile walking, I step on dry foliage, alerting the 2 Seekers.\nCharacter Action, General table: Combative, Creepy. Ugh.\nAppearance table: Interesting, Messy.\nUpon getting closer, the two human Seekers are evidently drunk or mentally affected by something. They approach me without prudence, unsheathing off some rusty swords.\nFQ: “Are they mind controlled?” 50/50. 6, 9. 15 total. Yes. That’s interesting.\nFQ: “Do they attack immediately?” 50/50. 9, 7. 16 total. Yes.\nFight!\nEach of them is a difficulty 5 foe since they are rank 1 like me. Effort equals to rank, so 1.\nSeeker 1 is brawny and stupid.\nSeeker 2 is agile and stupid.\nStupid due to the mind control.\nI unsheathe my sword and ready my shield. I wait for the first to attack.\nBrawny defence roll, so 3d6. 5, 6, 2. Exceptional success thanks to the 2 successes.\nI manage to defend easily from both attacks, even pushing S2 away with a kick.\nMy turn, I try to follow on the unbalanced foe, trying to disarm him.\nBrawny attack, 3d6. 6, 4, 1. Success.\nWith a quick hand movement, the sword flies away.\nS1 tries again. Brawny defence roll. 3, 4, 2. Fail. 1 damage to resolve, 2 remain.\nProfiting from my distraction, he manages to kick me on the side. I fall on the ground.\nI try to quickly recomposing and standing up. Agile standard challenge. 5, 1. Success.\nI manage to roll using the same momentum and return standing up, ready again. In the meantime, S2 is going for his sword. S1 continues attacking.\nS1 attack. Brawny defence. 4, 4, 1. I expend a karma to lower the difficulty to 4, so it’s an exceptional success. Still 1 karma left.\nI manage to parry his blow, grab his extended arm and hit the face with my pommel of the sword. S1 goes down unconscious.\nIn the meantime, S2 his near his sword\nI plunge to him, trying to kick away the sword before he reaches.\nAgile standard challenge. 2, 2. Fail.\nHe reaches for the sword while I kick it away.\nS2 attacks me while still on the ground.\nBrawny easy defence. 5, 2, 2. Success.\nI parry with my sword at the clumsy attack, S2 is still on the ground.\nI attack him again. Brawny easy challenge, due to him being on the ground. 6, 4, 1. Excep Success.\nImmediately after parrying I punch him in the face with the side of the shield, putting him unconscious.\nAfter this, I quickly grab my rope and tie them apart from each other and stand guard waiting for them to awake. I retake Ganke’s heirloom.\nEnd of Scene.\nI regain my resolve and karma back since it’s the end of the session.\nBookkeeping:\nI add “Hypnotised Seekers” to the Character list.\nSession 4 §\nScene 6 §\nCF: 6. Not totally in control, not without either, but I want some more chaos, so I lean on increasing.\nExpected Scene: Yuhdel interrogates the two, if possible.\nTest: 8. Expected Scene.\nYuhdel wait for the Seekers to wake up. After a few minutes, both start to regain consciousness.\nFQ: “Are they still hypnotized?” 50/50. 9. No.\nCharacter Conversations: Odd, Careful.\nYuhdel starts asking some general questions, who they are, why did they attack him, what did they do inside this old laboratory.\nCrafty challenge to get them to talk, difficulty 5. 5, 6. Critical success.\nThey initily are quite strange, as if hangover from alcohol. After a few attempts at some calming conversations they start to open up quickly.\nMotivations: Intellect, Mistrust.\nThey say that they entered the lab after following the advice of a fellow Seeker, which remained outside the Mind Shatter Field. After that, they don’t remember much.\nFQ: “Did they remember seeing Ganke?” Likely. 11. Yes.\nThey remember Ganke walking inside the lab, leaving some objects on the ground while walking deeper in the lab. They remember seeing him as someone to leave alone, but then they had the urge to check the heirloom for a reason they don’t remember.\nAfter being sure that they are really in themselves, Yuhdel frees them and gives them back their weapons, pointing them towards the closest border and the directions for the Village.\nEnd of Scene.\nBookkeping: Removed Hypnotized Seekers from list.\nScene 7 §\nCF: 5. Largely in control.\nExpected Scene: Going deeper in the lab exploration.\nTest: 8. Expected.\nArea 2\nLocation: 4. None or Expected.\nEncounters: Random. Descriptions: Intensely, Ruined.\nObjects: None or Expected.\nNot sure about the encounter. Let’s roll on Character skills: Lethal, Water.\nStill quite nebulous. What is it doing? Actions: Escape, Agreement.\nInterpretation:\nThe rooms of the former facility are quite in bad shape from water damage it seems, but in the first room most of it is dry, even if heavy with mould. The next room is instead slightly lower than the previous, resulting in a small fly of stairs entering in what seemed like a storage room, full of wooden and metal crates. There is some ankle deep water, coming from a ruptured tube. Some corpses are there, face down and slightly moved by the running water. An incline goes off from the other side, going back up into the lab.\nDoes Yuhdel notice the electrified water?\nA crafty challenge, difficulty 5. 5, 5. Crit success.\n*He notices the marks of electric death on the corpses and identifies a switch near the tube, maybe it’s a valve?\nHe tries to jump on the wooden crates to reach the valve.\n*\nAgile challenge, diff 4. 1, 2. Fail.\nWhile jumping on the wooden boxes, the time in water hasn’t helped at all the old wood. After a couple of good boxes, one breaks under his feets, uncovering what’s inside.\nFQ: “Is inside a dangerous object?” Unlikely. 5, 3. 7. No.\nObjects meaning table: Information, Empty.\nThe crate is actually empty and half full of water from cracks on the side. Yuhdel continues with the boxes.\nAgile challenge, diff 4. 5, 3. Success.\nYudel reaches the other side without more issues, going up again on the stone incline to the next location.\nArea 3\nLocation PP 2: 5. None or Expected.\nEncounters PP2: 9. Random. Characters table: Unexpected, Animal.\nObjects PP 2: 7. Expected.\nLet’s generate this animal.\nCreature Descriptors: Rooted, Tree-like.\nCreature Abilities: Pursue, Environment.\nAnimal Actions: Oppose, Friendship. Ops…\nFQ: “Is Ganke here?” 50/50. 11. Yes.\nIntepretation:\nYuhdel arrives in a big room. This has been flooded as well, but the water doesn’t seem electrified. A lot of plant life seems to have grown here, creating a swamp-like environment, with big trees dominating the almost unrecognizable room, lit by a blue crystal attached to the ceiling, providing a good quantity of light and electrical energy. Almost immediately, he notices that the bigger trees are moving, as if some of the lower branches acted like arms. They seem rooted in place though. After a moment, he sees Ganke there.\nFQ: “Is he back in control of his body?” 50/50. 2, 3. 5. No.\nGanke is unconscious and against a bigger tree in the center, which seems to be slowly engolfing him in a web of roots. Some other trees near Yuhdel instead try to throw some lab debris at him.\nTime for action!\nBrawny defense roll, 3d6. Diff 5. 5, 5, 1. Crit success.\n*The flying debris passeswhere a moment before was Yuhdel’s head. He ducks down and searches for something to damage the trees. His sword will not help in woodcutting…\nFQ: “Is there something useful against the moving trees?” Likely, due to them being born in the same place. 8, 5. 14. Yes.\nObjects table: Stolen, Complicated. Let’s do another couple. Cold, Soft.\n*Looking around in the room, some of the old machinery is still visible among the growth. Some glass containers seem to be filled with a snow-looking substance, which is at the center of a spot in the wall clean of vegetation, as if inhibited by it.\nYuhdel hopes for the best, trying to get some of the substance on the trees. *\nFQ: “Is the container open?” 50/50. 3, 3. 6. No with random event! 13. New NPC!\nChar Appearance: Feminine, Tools.\nDescriptors: Bleak, Macabre.\nSkills: Intellect, Change\nCharacter Actions, Combat: Rude, Swift.\nOh my… off to an interesting start.\nWhen Yuhdel starts to touch the container, a feminine voice is heard: “I would not touch that if I were you! DUCK!”\nAnd almost immediately, a sound of infringing glass is heard, followed by an explosion.\nAgile challenge, diff 6 for the surprise. 2d6. 1, 6. Success.\nYuhdel manages to take cover behind a crate, avoiding the blast. Immediately firing trees are eveywhere, the unknown helper is hacking away at the roots surrounding Ganke.\nAfter this sudden explosion, Yuhdel has the occasion of seeing the new arrival. A young lizardfolk woman with pale green scales, wearing some traveler’s clothes and a number of bags on herself. A belt full of small glass vials, with multicolored substances is going diagonally on her chest. A good portion of her face and neck is missing scales, with some deformed flesh in its place, probably from a past accident.\nWhile observing, the flaming tree that is being chopped off reacts, trying to hit her while distracted by the wood chopping.\nYuhdel tries to intercept the blow.\nBrawny defese, 3d6. Diff 5. 5, 4, 6. Crit success.\nYuhdel succeeds in that using the shield, while quickly noticing a small opening in the main trunk. He quickly recognizes one of the vials on her belt and grabs it. “For the tree!” He says. He puts the vial in the opening and prepares to hit it with his sword.\nBrawny diff 5. 3d6. 5, 3, 4. Success.\n*The vial is broken, outpouring the slightly yellow liquid on the trunk, which immediately starts to hiss from the acidic reaction and shrivels to a quarter of the size, blackening in the process. The roots also stop moving, letting the lizardwoman (? Real word?) free Ganke, still unconscious.\nThe trio then swiftly clears the room, going back in the previous place, while the swampy room starts filling with smoke and the hissing sound of the dying awakened-trees.\nThe Seeker and the lizardfolk look at each other, while carrying Ganke.\n“We should be safe now” says the woman. “They can’t reach us here”.\nShe looks a bit displeased by the situation. “What was your friend doing, hugging a tree like that? Don’t you know where you are?”\nAfter noticing the puzzled look on Yuhdel’s face, she sighs visibly. “Dam’ rookies… Name’s Bashag’Oth by the way. Bash will do.”\n“I’m Yuhdel… And thanks back there… What were those trees?”\n*\nFQ: “Does Ganke awaken?” Very Likely.  7, 5. 14. Yes.\nThey both check on Ganke’s status and wait for him to fully regain consciousness before continuing to talk.\nEnd of Scene.\nAdd Bashag’Oth to Characters list.\nIncrease CF to 6, got saved by Bash.\nScene 8 §\nCF: 6, saved by Bash.\nExpected Scene: Conversation with Bash on what happened.\nTest: 3. Altered Scene. Alteration Table: Add an Object. Object Meaning table: Worn, Unexpected.\nCurses table: Abandon, Evil.\nI guess I will need to have some serious backstory for her. Let’s use Adventure Crafter and Inline Scripts. I will setup the theme priority as Tension, Action, Mystery, Social and Personal, respectively. The chosen thread will be about the Mind Shatter Field, since she was not here for Ganke. Or is it?\nFQ: “Is she here for us?” At previous CF 5. Very Unlikely. 5, 7. 10. No.\nLet’s roll a turning point for her backstory.\n\nTurning point:\n\nSOMETHING IS GETTING AWAY    (ACTION)\n\nThis Turning Point involves a time limit where, at the end of it, something will get away. For instance, a ship carrying a magic artifact is about to leave the dock and a Character has to fight their way through a pack of armed goons to board the ship before it sets sail.\n\n\nA CHARACTER DISAPPEARS    (MYSTERY)\n\nA Character is nowhere to be found. Whether there is evidence or not as to what happened to the Character is up to you depending on the other Plot Points involved in this Turning Point.\n\n\nHIDDEN THREAT    (TENSION)\n\nThere is a threat in this Turning Point that has been in the Adventure previous to this Turning Point but went undetected. This could be anything from an evil spirit lurking in an ancient vase to a virus in a person’s body to a good guy who turns out to be a bad guy, etc.\n\n\nNONE\nNONE\n\n\nShe has a time limit regarding a character who has disappeared. Since in my list I don’t have much choice, the only result that would make sense is the “Seekers” entry. The hidden threat is the same author for the mind control of Ganke and the two previous Seekers.\nShe is the leader of a small Seeker party. The 2 previous Seeker were part of it. She is now trying to search for another member here. She explains her objective to Yuhdel.\nThe worn object is a necklace of lizard-folk teeths, which are slightly green-tinted and with traces of burning in some spots. Those type of necklaces are used in military spaces, maybe she has such past?\n*Bash speaks to Ganke, with a caring but tired tone: “Easy there, I don’t need another dreamer on my obituary list for hitting the head falling…”\nGanke looks around: “Where am I? What happened?”\nAfter a brief summary of events by Yuhdel, he remains incredulous to what he did.\nSession 5 §\nWhile Ganke thinks about it, Yuhdel goes to Bash: “So, you saved us. Now we will help you finding your companion. Do you think it’s safe to cross the previous room now?”\nFQ: “Is it safe now?” Likely. 10, 2. 14. Yes.\nBash escorts them to the next room, everyone covering their noses against the chemical smell of burnt wood and alchemy.\nEvent Crafter:\n\nLocation PP 3: 11. 1d10 Or Random. 3 Rolled over. Choose Lab Feature.\nEncounters PP 3: 11. 1d10 or Random. 6. Seekers (!)\nObjects PP 3: 10. 1d10 or Random. 8. Rolled over. Choose Residuum, Loot time!\nI guess we found our missing Seeker.\nLet’s roll for the Lab Feature.\nLocations Meaning Table: Protected, Reassuring.\nActions Table: Communicate, Health.\nNow for the Residuum.\nMagic Items. Harm, Enhance.\nInterpretation:\nUpon entering, they find what was probably some kind of hospital ward, with remains of wooden beds with still mattresses remains on top. Some foliage from the previous room is present as well.\nThe place is run down, with some broken furniture and beds. Some old machinery is there as well, which helped monitor patients’ health.\nFQ: “Is the source of this mind control here?” Likely. 10, 7. 19. Exceptional Yes!\nNot only it’s here, but it has help, whatever it is.\nCharacters: Old, Loud.\nAppearence: Powerful, Simple\nActions, General: Take, Move\nInterpretation:\nWhat appear to be at first a big mound of rubble and wooden pieces next to the bed where a man is deeply sleeping, surrounded by machines and crystals floating around, reveals itself to be some kind of vaguely humanoid construct, made from cheap material found in the room. The wooden pieces and the rubble moves in coordinated effort, swaying with some delay at every movement of the standing being. It’s quite tall and massive, doing a lot of noise due to the friction of the fragments forming its body amongst each other.\nFQ: “Does it speak?” 50/50.  7, 3. 11. Yes.\nConversations: Aggressive, Judgmental.\nPersonality: Create, Stop.\nAt this point, I need to know the motive of this kidnapper to do this.\nMotivations Table. Reveal, Fame.\nI need some more tables.\nActions: Ruin Bureaucracy.\nDescriptions: Happily Festive.\nA voice comes from the pile of rubble, as if composed by a multitude of voices screaming from a well: “”"},"Solo-Games/Cursed-Kingdom-Playtest/Script-backup":{"title":"Script backup","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"State:\n{“lists”:{“pcs”:{“type”:“basic”,“content”:[]},“npcs”:{“type”:“basic”,“content”:[]},“threads”:{“type”:“basic”,“content”:[]},“plotline_dupes”:{“type”:“basic”,“content”:[“Avoid bounty”,“Bring back Ganke alive”,“Bring back some Residuum”,“Explore the Mind Shatter Field”]},“plotlines”:{“type”:“combo”,“content”:[“threads”,“plotline_dupes”]},“character_dupes”:{“type”:“basic”,“content”:[“Bashag’Oth the Alchemist”,“Electrical Magitech Labratorium”,“Ganke”,“Seekers”,“The Village”,“The Wolf”,“Yuhdel”]},“characters”:{“type”:“combo”,“content”:[“pcs”,“npcs”,“character_dupes”]}},“notevars”:{“isMarkdownRefreshed”:true},“notepick”:{},“mythicgme”:{“chaos”:5,“scene”:1},“adventurecrafter”:{“themeSlots”:[0,2,1,3,4],“priorPickWas3”:false},“cards”:{“piles”:{},“size”:150,“priorShowMoved”:true,“backImage”:null},“tablefiles”:{“paths”:{},“configuration”:{}},“clips”:{},“eventCrafter”:{“activeSheet”:“Factory”,“sheets”:{“Factory”:{“categories”:{“Location”:{“content”:[{“name”:“Log__Cutting__Room”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Management__Offices”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Wood__Chemical__Treatment”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Water__Canal”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Slave__Work__Rooms”,“unique”:0}],“pp”:1,“randomized”:true,“concluding”:“short”,“uniqueIndicesRemoved”:[]},“Encounters”:{“content”:[{“name”:“Kobolds”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Constructs”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Guards”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Employees”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Laid__off__Workers”,“unique”:0}],“pp”:1,“randomized”:true,“concluding”:“short”,“uniqueIndicesRemoved”:[]},“Objects”:{“content”:[{“name”:“Kobold__Trap”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Security__Trap”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Broken__Machinery”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Broken__Constructs”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Dead__Kobolds”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Secret__or__Clue”,“unique”:0},{“name”:“Magic__Item”,“unique”:0}],“pp”:1,“randomized”:true,“concluding”:“short”,“uniqueIndicesRemoved”:[]}}}}}}"},"Solo-Games/Cursed-Kingdom-Playtest/Yuhdel":{"title":"Yuhdel","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Name: Yuhdel\nArchetype: A brawny human warrior with magic abilities\nPerks: Magical Knowledge (Ritualistic, takes time)\nQuirks: Over-planner\nCombat style: Brawny\nRank: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolveKarma33\nResolve (health, will, spirit etc) §\nKarma (spent on perks, gained from quirks) §\nHe has long dark hairs, a robust built body and some runes tattooed on his right arm.

§\nThis is a fantasy hexcrawl campaign. My main drive for this game is to test Savage Worlds Adventure Edition and a bunch of other tools.\nFor this campaign I’ll use a few tools:\n\nSWADE\nSWADE Fantasy Companion\nMythic GME 2e\n\nFate Check\nFluid Scenes (from a Mythic Magazine, I’ll play without the discrete scene structure. Instead a Scene Question will be asked at turning points, to see if the Chaos Factor changes)\nNews Feeds to generate events in the locations that I’ll find\nMystery Matrix, in case of mystery to investigate\n\n\nHexcrawl Toolkit for the hexcrawl procedure (only the required rules, to keep things simple.) Can be found at Hexcrawl Resources.\nSpectacular Settlements, to generate important settlements.\nLocation and Event Crafter\nStretch goals, if I have the occasion/inclination to do so:\n\nSolipsism, for location generation using a choose-your-own-adventure-book style\nPlot/Game/Scene Unfolding Machine tools. To be used mainly for inspiration tables. If I feel fancy, I could switch to PUM at some point instead of Mythic GME for the oracle as well.\nFlexAI to run monsters, especially in combat\nLet’s Talk, for conversations.\n\n\n\nWorld Building §\nI created a town using Spectacular Settlements, called Hoverkirk.\nThis town was born around a temple, which is airborne due to the magical anomaly that is protecting.\nThis magical anomaly led to the discovery of a magical crystal, used by its inhabitants as a source of energy and to develop magitech items.\nThis ushered an economic boom for this remote town, which was providing their services of airships powered by crystals, for trading all over the world.\nThe flying temple where the magical anomaly is, is managed and protected by the Arcane Protectors.\nA separate faction within this group, called the Red Arcanists, have taken a more religious view of the magical anomaly, starting an internal strife with the Arcane Protectors.\nIn recent history, this conflict has reached a point where the group has separated, leaving the town and, in the last few days, hijacking an airship for unknown reasons.\nOur party, composed of a joke-cracking Dwarf Cleric of Tramadir named Drukmor and the grim Human Soldier Gultag, have accepted the mission from the Protectors to retrieve the airship. The only lead for now is the Red Arcanists Watchtower, where the group has been seen.\nSession 1 §\nWe start with the mission already taken, ready to leave Hoverkirk for the Red Arcanists Watchtower.\n\n\n                   \n                  Hexcrawl \n                  \n                \nStarting with 6 APs.\nMoved to Plains 026.022 hex. 2 APs.\nRolled no POIs.\nNext Plains hex 027.021. 2 APs.\nFound a Faction POI.\nI guess we found the Watchtower!\n\nHere is our current map.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nWhat do we see?\nBoth Drukmor and Gultag do a Notice check.\nDrukmor: 4. Gultag: 5. Both successes.\nDescriptor: Intensely Healthy.\n\n\nOnce arrived near the watchtower, they see a relatively low and thick stone building, with a flat top. More than for scouting, the building seems to be a small keep. Around the circular base, a square multifloor building protrudes from a side, giving more living space.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Mythic \n                  \n                \nIs the airship here? Likely. CF 5. Forgot to check the Scene, oh well. It’s Expected. CF to 6. 6, 1. 9. No.\n\n\nOne thing they immediately notice is the lack of airship hovering near the top of the tower, the only place where it would be.\n“Where is the ship?” says Gultag.\n“We are going to ask inside.” says Drukmor, with a smirk.\nThe duo looks at the situation.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nDrukmor Notice: 4.\nGultag Notice: 3.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Mythic \n                  \n                \nAre there any guards outside? Likely. 5, 1. 8. No.\n\n\nBoth don’t see anyone outside the building, but probably lookouts are inside looking from windows. Or not.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Solipsism \n                  \n                \nLet’s use Solipsism to explore this location.\nI fill up this Map. Should be faster than setting up LC or anything else.\n\nWe start from 1002 after rolling a d4.\nGo to 7197. Location A, -2 (everything easier 2 steps during this scene), hallucination mood word, Path 7588 with +2 modifier.\n\n\nThe duo reaches slowly the entrance of the low stone building hugging the side of the tower and opens the door.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Mythic \n                  \n                \nIs it locked? Likely. 9, 5. 14. Yes.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nThievery skill check to lockpick it.\nMalus of -2 given by the Solipsism modifier. Both are also unskilled at it…\nGultag: 3. Drukmor… -3 with both 1s. So, Critical Failure.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Mythic \n                  \n                \nIs there a trap? Likely. 8, 1. 11. Yes.\nIt’s a fire trap, that sends a flameout in the face of Drukmor. 1d6 damage, 3 and doesn’t catch fire. Soaked by his Toughness of 7, so no damage.\n\n\nDrukmor cough for the improvise fire, but a part from some burned out hairs on his dwarven beard and a burned ego, nothing else happens.\nThe door is still closed.\n“Damn door, that’s the last drop of my 1-drop container” says Drakmor, preparing to impulsively hit the door.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nFighting roll with his light club. 5. 5 damage.\nEnough to break down the door I guess.\n\n\nThe duo enters past the ruined door.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Mythic \n                  \n                \nDomicile: Lightly Damaged.\nFQ: Is there anyone? Likely. 10, 8. 20. Extreme Yes.\nI guess a combat is ongoing. Who are the Red Arcanists fighting? Let’s roll on the Characters list. Town Watch Lieutenant.\n\n\nThe interior of this one-room building appears damaged in its furniture, this is due to an ongoing skirmish between two groups, doing what seems a unorganized brawl among tables of what seemed once a trading post main local. Weapons are unsheathed, more heated than a tavern brawl.\nTown Guards, together with the Lieutenant, are engaged.\nThe due comes to aid and a short combat ensues (done in Foundry), where three mages of the Red Arcanists are killed, without allied hurts.\n\n\n[!SUM/GUM] SUM/GUM\nWho is the Lieutenant? Let’s use SUM and GUM\nStereotype: Chooser of the Chosen One: Often an older mentor / Liar: Character who consistently can’t tell the truth\nAttitude: Despite disliking you, remain respectful and calm\nContribution: Talks about a useful, dangerous, or wonderful place\nGUM Useful Findings: Personal relationships of an enemy\n\n\nThe Lieutenant thanks us with a smidge of embarrassment. He doesn’t like adventurers like us, that is known across the village.\nHe talks about his attack to the tower in an effort to retrieve the airship as well, but he says that the vehicle was moved away as soon as they attacked, blowing the surprise of the attack just before doing it.\nThey tried to conquer the structure but were still engaging with the first group of defenders. More are probably in the next locations here. Conquering the structure might prove beneficial for the town of Hoverkirk though, so they ask us to finish the job, while they try to keep up with the airship movements. A message will be sent as soon as they have information.\nDo the PCs catch the lie?\n\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nNotice.\nDrukmor: 11. Success with raise.\nGultag: 2. Fail.\n\n\nDrukmor understands that no call will ever arrive from the Lieutenant, he doesn’t like “mercenaries”. The hopes of reaching a moving airship on foot are quite slim, so maybe they will find some clues on the destination inside the tower, or from a Red Arcanist.\nThe duo agrees with the Lieutenant, parting ways.\nThey both continue inside the main body of the tower.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Solipsism \n                  \n                \nPath 7588 goes to 8091.\n\nFinal modifier: +1\nB is Tower Ground Floor, with an Ethereal theme.\nObject 1 is “Clue about airship”. Lucky! With a positive theme as well. Final modifier regarding the clue is 0.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  GUM \n                  \n                \nUseful Findings: Confirmation of intel, proof, evidence\nClue type: Infomally written notes.\nEnemy activities: Talking to someone secretely, plotting.\nLocation by content: Religious artifacts, symbols, offerings, rituals\n\nThis tracks with the ethereal theme from Solipsism.\nWhat is this faction doing with the religious altar?\n\n\n                   \n                  GUM \n                  \n                \nFaction focus: Ascension: Aims to achieve a higher state of being, power, or enlightenment\nSurplus: Religion: Strong, devout, or charismatic faith to motivate, heal, or convert others\nNeeds: Trade: Stability, goods, services, or markets that they can use to sell and buy things\n\n\n\n                   \n                  PUM \n                  \n                \nWhy the altars?\nReason (Why): For protection or survival\nExplain (Why): Accident, side effect\n\nThe Red Arcanists have developed a religious belief around the crystals and want to use them for some side effect. I’ll leave it undefined for now, it’s not really needed.\nThe airship is useful for trading or financial help and the clue is evidence, regarding the airship probably.\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nGultag and Drukmor enters the main tower building, where the circular room has spiraling stairs along the perimeter of the stone walls. The open space has been adapted to some kind of religious temple and general work area, dividing the space evenly between the two functions.\nThe religious space has some pieces of Crystal on an altar, encased in a metal handler, but kept unpolished and still slightly glowing in magical energy.\nThe work area instead has some correspondence between Red Arcanists where they agree on keeping the airship moving in case of retaliation from Hoverkirk, plotting the airship’s itinerary to a second place.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  GUM \n                  \n                \nLocation by purpose: Hospitality, food, sleep, drinks, socializing\n\nI would say some kind of tavern. Since it’s controlled by the Red Arcanists, it’s going to be outside, so maybe more of a small trading post than a single building.\n\nThe trading post is called The Drinking Fire, but the location is not shared.\n\nDo they know the place?\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nCommon Knowledge\nDrukmor: 4\nGultag: 5\n\nSince they know where it is, during the hexcrawl after each discovered feature, I’ll ask a FQ whether we arrived. If yes, we found the place.\nThe duo continues their exploration of the tower.\nIt’s also time for a Scene Question.\n“They finish exploring the ground floor without issues and move to the next area, right?” 9. Expected, CF increases to 7.\n\n\n                   \n                  Solipsism \n                  \n                \nOutgoing Path: 4141 at -1.\nGo To: 4875\n\nLocation C is First Floor with surveillance theme. No modified difficulty.\nDanger 1 is Red Arcanists guards with optics flavor. Characters harder by 1 step.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  GUM \n                  \n                \nLocation by content: Darkness, invisible, hard to see, fuzzy, nothing\nCharacter by possession: Rich, wealthy, fancy clothes, ornaments, rings\n\n\nThe floor is kept in the dark, with most of the light coming from what can be described as irregular pieces of glass floating in mid air and as big as a person. On each side of each piece of glass, moving images of other locations can be seen. The duo recognizes the locations showed as different parts of Hoverkirk, but also other locations, together with the The Drinking Fire trading post, this very tower and other kingdoms.\nSeems like the RA is monitoring places by unknown, probably magical, means, but no one seems to notice  being observed.\n\nFQ:“Do the RA present here ambush them?” Very Likely given the ongoing attack they are aware of. 1, 2. 5 total. No, almost exceptional.\nWhat’s their attitude then?\n\n\n                   \n                  SUM \n                  \n                \nRolling with disadvantage since they should tend negative towards the PCs.\nAttitude: Act very defensively, ready for a fight if it has to be.\nContribution: Has a weapon, or means to complicate PCs goals\nOpinion: Disagree, dislike and will oppose it however they can\n\nOk… this is confusing. Do the PCs notice them in the darkness at least?\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nNotice check\nDrukmor: 8. Success with raise\nGultag: 4.

Yes\n\n\nWhile looking at the spying glasses, the duo spots a couple of opulently dressed Red Arcanists, with their red robes enriched by some jewelry, denoting their status as specialists. Probably about this type of divination magic.\nBoth of them are in a corner, hands in the air after seeing from a glass the battle that just ended. One of them has what seems to be a round device with a piece of cloth coming out of the metal frame, a lit torch in the other hand.\n“Stop there! Not a step further or all this glass explodes in your face!”\nDrukmor: “Whoah whoah whoah kiddo, you’re serious about the acupuncture regime there? I can patch me and my buddy together, not sure I’ll be in the mood for you as well”\n\n\n\n                   \n                  SWADE \n                  \n                \nPersuasion check\nDrukmor: d8, d6. 1, 2.\nBenny time! 1, 4. Success.\n\n\nThe cultists look at each other, feeling a bit stupid after what they thought was going to be a good plan.\n“Please spare us, we can be of help! Just let us go!”\n\n\n\n                   \n                  PUM \n                  \n                \nWhy the theft of the airship? Obtain object you get/have.

The images will be aligned around their center points.\nThe control box in the top right of the map will allow you to change layers.\nMarkers can be created and saved on each layer separately from one another.\nIf multiple images are provided, an ID must be given to the map, or the map will only display the first provided image.\nLatitude and Longtitude of Image Maps §\nBecause an image map does not have a true coordinate system, the latitude and longitude provided must be given as a percentage from the top left corner of the image.\nThis setting may seem to not do anything without changing the default zoom level of the map.\nUnit and Scale §\nIf provided, the plugin will scale the calculated distance between two points by scale and display the result as xxx unit.\nMarkers §\nNew markers can be added to the map by right clicking.\nIf any additional marker types have been created in the settings, a list will appear to choose from.\nOnce a marker has been created, it can be dragged to a different location.\nMarkers created on the map will be saved to the map instance. Marker data saved this way will persist as long as the map is associated with a note - if the map blocks are removed from notes, or if all of the notes containing map blocks are removed, the data associated with it will be deleted after 7 days.\nMarker Coordinates §\nAlt-clicking on a marker will reveal its coordinates.\nMarker Links §\nA marker can also point to a note; right-click on it, and a popup will appear. The target can be entered as the name of the note. Additionally, headers or blocks within a note can be the target of a marker:\nNote\nNote#Header1\nIf you have multiple notes with the same name, you should specify the direct path to the note. Otherwise, the map may not open the one you expect.\nOnce linked, a click will open the note (Ctrl/Cmd-click to open in new window).\nAdditionally, markers can be created by dragging a note from the file tree and dropping it on the map.\nMarker links can also be set to external websites. Clicking the marker will open the website.\nObsidian Commands as Links §\nMarkers links can also be set to a defined Obsidian command from the command palette. This must be the full name of the command as it appears in the palette.\nSetting a marker link to a command will execute the command when the marker is clicked.\nMarkers Defined in the Code Block §\nMarkers may be defined directly in the code block using the following syntax:\nmarker: &lt;type&gt;,&lt;latitude&gt;,&lt;longitude&gt;,&lt;link&gt;\nAn arbitrary number of markers can be defined, but none of these markers will be editable. If a change needs to be made to these markers, the code block must be edited.\nThe marker link may be defined as an Obsidian wikilink.\nThese markers will not be included in exported marker data.\nMarker Files, Marker Folders and Marker Tags §\nThese parameters allow you to create markers directly from a list of markdown note files.\nA note specified in this manner should have the following frontmatter tags:\nlocation: [lat, long] REQUIRED\nmapmarker: &lt;marker-type&gt; OPTIONAL\nThere is no limit to how many of these parameters you can have defined in the code block; all of the files found will be parsed for defined markers.\nPlease note that until I can utilize some form of caching, having a large amount of marker files defined could impact performance.\nMarker File §\nMarker files may be defined in the code block using the following syntax:\nmarkerFile: [[WikiLinkToFile]] OR\nmarkerFile: Direct/Path/To/Note\nMarker Folders §\nMarker folders may be defined in the code block using the following syntax:\nmarkerFolder: Direct/Path/To/Folder\nThis will search through all of the notes in the specified folder, even in sub folders.\nMarker Tags §\nIf you have the Dataview plugin installed, markers may also be created from tags using the following syntax:\nmarkerTag: #&lt;tag&gt;, #&lt;tag&gt;, ...\nEach markerTag parameter will return notes that have all of the tags defined in that paramter. If you are looking for files containing any tag listed, use separate markerTag parameters.\nIf one or more markerFolder parameters are specified, the markerTag parameter will only look for notes in the folders that contain the tags.\nExamples §\nmarkerFile: [[MarkerFile]]\n\nwould\n\nLoad the MarkerFile.md note file and, if it has the correct frontmatter fields, create a marker for it.\n\nmarkerFile: [[MarkerFile]]\nmarkerFolder: People and Locations\n\nwould\n\nLoad the MarkerFile.md note\nLook through the People and Locations folder for additional notes\n\nmarkerTag: &quot;#&quot;location, &quot;#&quot;friends\n\nwould\n\nFind all notes tagged with both #location and #friends and create markers using their frontmatter\n\nmarkerFolder: People and Locations\nmarkerFolder: Interests/Maps of the World\nmarkerTags: &quot;#&quot;people, &quot;#&quot;friends\nmarkerTags: &quot;#&quot;Paris\n\nwould search for notes that\n\nAre in the folders People and Locations OR Interests/Maps of the World, AND\nContain both tags # people AND # friends OR the tag # Paris\n\nMarker CSV File §\nMarker data may be exportable to a CSV file. This data takes the following format:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1Column 2Column 3Column 4Column 5Column 6Column 7Map IDMarker TypeLatitudeLongitudeMarker LinkMarker LayerMarker ID\nMap ID is the path to the note plus “real” for real maps OR the path to the image OR the map id defined in the code block. Example:\nPath/To/Note.md/Path/To/File.jpg OR\nPath/To/Note.md/real OR\nPath/To/Note.md/map-id-defined-in-code-block\nIf left blank, Marker Type will default to “default”.\nMarker layer may be kept blank if a map only has 1 layer.\nFor new markers, Marker ID may be kept blank.\nMarker data in this format can then be re-imported. This feature is still under development and may not work as expected.\nDistances §\nCtrl/Cmd-clicking the map, then Ctrl/Cmd-clicking again, will display the distance between the two points.\nReal-world map distances are displayed in meters.\nImage maps can have an optional unit and scaling factor provided to display.\nConfiguration §\nNote Preview §\nUse Obsidian’s note preview when hovering a linked marker.\nPlease note, the Obsidian Page preview core plugin must be enabled to use this feature.\nLatitude and Longitude §\nA real-world map will open to this default latitude and longitude if not provided.\nBase Marker §\nThe base marker setting allows you to define a marker that other markers can be layered on top of. If no additional markers have been added, right clicking on the map will place this marker.\nAdditional Markers §\nAdditional marker types can be added, selectable from a context menu on the map.\nCreating an additional marker §\nAdding a new marker displays a new window, where the new marker parameters can be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameterDescriptionMarker NameDisplayed in the context menu when adding a marker (e.g., Location, Event, Person)Marker IconName of the Font Awesome icon to useLayer IconLayer this icon on top of the base marker. If off, the icon itself will be used.Icon ColorOverride the default icon color\nIf layer icon is on, the icon be moved around the base icon by clicking and dragging, to customize where the icon is layered. If Shift is held while moving the icon, it will snap to the midlines.\nVersion History §\n3.0.0 §\nNew Features §\n\nMap IDs are now required.\n\nA map that does not have an id will not render\nThe plugin will try to load previously defined marker data once an id has been given to the map.\nThis means marker definitions are no longer tied to maps - giving a map on a different note the same ID will load the same marker data\n\n\nMarker data that is not associated with a file will now be deleted after 7 days to prevent data accumulation\nMap data is now only saved if the map has defined markers\nImage files can now be linked using an Obsidian wikilink (e.g., Image Name.jpg)\nNew markerFile and markerFolder parameters in maps\n\nmarkerFile will read a note file’s frontmatter and create a marker based on the marker and location tags\n\nmarker should be a defined marker type (will default to default if not provided)\nlocation should be a array of [latitude, longitude]. If not provided, the marker will not be created\nThe marker link target will be set to the file\n\n\nmarkerFolder will read all of the files in the folder, and try to parse the frontmatter as above.\n\n\nMade display of marker link in tooltip consistent with Obsidian’s display style\nAdded data attributes to marker HTML element\n\ndata-type: marker type\ndata-link: marker link target, if any\ndata-mutable: whether marker data can be edited\ndata-type: marker type name (such as default)\n\n\nSwitched from uuid to 6 digit nanoid\nRendering improvements\n\nBug Fixes §\n\nFixed issue where a new marker type’s Layer Icon setting was not respecting the default layer marker setting\nFixed issue where clicking a marker could open the context menu\nFixed issue where clicking a marker without a link could cause an error\nFixed issue with opening a marker link defined with alt-text\nFixed issue where resizing the leaf containing a map caused it to calculate marker positions incorrectly\nFixed issue where having the same map open in multiple windows was not adding markers correctly\nFixed issue where dragging a marker created on a map open in multiple views would not drag correctly on other maps\nFixed issue where turning the plugin off would leave map tiles in random locations on open notes\nFixed issue where showing the note preview of a note with a map that is already open in the workspace would cause the map to be disassociated\n\n2.1.0 §\n\nAdded marker parameter in code block\nFixed issue where importing a CSV file that changed a marker on an open map failed to update the marker information\n\n2.0.0 §\n\nAdded ability to export marker data to a CSV file\nAdded ability to import marker data from a CSV file\nAdded Obsidian-like file chooser to marker link path\n\n1.3.0 §\n\nRemoved requirement for file path in marker target\nAdded ability to target blocks in marker target\n\n1.2.0 §\n\nAdd rudimentary distance calculation between two points on the map\nFixed issue where opening the same map in multiple leaves could cause one map to de-render\n\n1.1.0 §\n\nMaps now recalculate their sizing when the window is resized\n\n1.0.0 §\n\nSwitch to proper semantic versioning\nAdded Note Preview setting\n\nThis setting displays the Obsidian page preview when you hover over a linked marker\n\n\nMap height can now be in provided as a percentage\n\n0.3.1 §\n\nAdded image map layers\n\nIt is now possible to have an arbitrary number of image maps layered on top of each other by supplying multiple images to the code block\nMarkers created on a specific layer are only displayed when that layer is active\nNavigation between layers is done using the layer control box in the top right\n\n\n\n0.2.2 §\n\nAdded real-world maps\nAdded latitude and longitude options\nAdded zoom delta option\nAdded tooltip display on markers that link to notes\nBug fixes\n\nInstallation §\nFrom within Obsidian §\nFrom Obsidian v0.9.8, you can activate this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:\n\nOpen Settings &gt; Third-party plugin\nMake sure Safe mode is off\nClick Browse community plugins\nSearch for this plugin\nClick Install\nOnce installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin\n\nFrom GitHub §\n\nDownload the Latest Release from the Releases section of the GitHub Repository\nExtract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault’s plugins folder: &lt;vault&gt;/.obsidian/plugins/\nNote: On some machines the .obsidian folder may be hidden.

Since Traveller is quite modular, I will be keeping things on the leaner side to simplify bookkeeping.\nIn this campaign, the party of 4 PCs are recruited by King Oleb of the system Drinax, asking them to become privateers for him to try and influence nearby systems to join his kingdom, once covering a vast area of the Trojan Reach sector.\nNo guidance is given in how to achieve this, but the King provides free use of the Harrier ship. An ancient spacecraft from the destruction of the Drinax planet, 200 years prior, which has seen better days but it’s still functional despite some broken systems.\nNow the King reigns from his high tech orbital palace, overseeing his radioactive planet and trying to come out of the irrelevance that the Aslan Hierate condemned them when they bombarded the planet 200 years ago.\nDrinax and other nearby systems are in a free space between the Aslan Hierate and the enormous Third Imperium.\nIn this situation, our PCs start moving.\nThey can be traders, pirates, heroes and villains.\nThe objective is winning the favour of other systems to recreate the once great Drinaxian Empire.\nOr should they? Maybe for now…\nWe have the 4 PCs:\n\nWilliam Adams: a human with a preexisting career in University, then the Navy as Engineer, reaching the grade of Sublieutenant. After retiring, he started working for the Scouts, an organization tasked with exploring and surveying the galaxy.\nJake Moore: a human who tried to enter in the Army Academy and his poverty forced him to seek pirating. After a long career full of heists, he finally gets imprisoned during a botched job. He just came out.\nTagon: an Aslan artist. This lion-like creature comes from a good family of nobility and passed most of his life as a socialite and made a name of himself as a writer of a certain success. After getting bored, he used his connections to land a job in Administration, where he made numerous friends. He was on Drinax and got involved for mere curiosity.\nIrthur: a Vargr full of resources. This worlf-like creature started as a free trader after failing entry to the Marines Academy. He soon lost everything and got drafted in the Army in a support role. For several years he successfully worked there, learning a lot, especially in medicine and electronics. After reaching a good pension, he mustered out to finally start his own thing, with the help of the others.\n\nAll of them know each other from the various events.\nSession 1 §\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                  \n                \n                \nCF: 5\nWe already have a mission. We could start by going to the nearest systems.\nWe have Asim and Pourne next door.\nAsim has UWP B867564-6 and trade codes Ag Ni Ga O:2324, PBG 205.\nLet’s translate this.\nB: Good starport. Berthing cost 500 cr, refined fuel available 500/ton. Shipyard and repairs.\nSize 8: standard Earth sized\n6: standard atmosphere\n7: around 70% water coverage\n5: population 10^5. Around 100k to 1M inhabitants\n6: Gov: Captive government. It’s a colony of Drinax.\n4: Law level. Banned weapons are military and light assault weapons. No Cloth armor or better. Looks like we need to go without armor or risk it.\n6: Tech level. Kinda around beginning of 1900 level.\nAg: Agricultural\nNi: Non-Industrial\nGa: Garden\nNo idea about O, can’t find it.\nP: Pop multiplier, so 200k inhabitants\nB: Bases, nothing.\nG: 5 gas giants\nPourne has UWP A9B2887-A and trade codes Fl He Ph, PBG 902\nA: Excellent starport. 1k cr berthing, refined fuel, shipyard for everything.\n9: Size: Big planet, 1.25g\nB: atmosphere. Corrosive, need vacc suit.\n2: around 20% water. Small seas.\n8: pop 10^8. 100M inhabitants. 900M inhabitants counting the P.\n8: Gov type. Civil service Bureaucracy.\n7: law level; Banned all firing weapons, melee permitted. No visible armor.\nA: Tech level 10. Quite advanced, but not too much.\nFl: Fluid oceans. He and Ph not present in book, so probably different version of Traveller.\nNo bases, 2 gas giants.\nAsim is already a colony of Drinax, the only one actually. So Pourne seems like a good first step. Even if corrosive, it provides with an industrial base and can be a good commercial partner.\n\nAccording to the books, Pourne is governed by a paranoid bureaucratic caste that assumes all offworlders to be saboteurs, probably. There are high planetary defenses and the starport in orbit is governed with aggressive guards. The place remains a trade hub thanks to its stability and tech level. Nice place.\nI could try to recruit some crew to man the ship, but we are broke, so better not risk mutinies or people going away.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nTo learn the rules, I will try to do some passenger carrying from Drinax to Pourne, to raise some easy money.\nWe have 8 staterooms, 4 available and 8 low berths. There are enough in Drinax going to Pourne to fill the ship, so I’ll need to turn some away.\nTagon Broker skill check plus modifiers from Drinax and Pourne population levels and starport level give a total of DM5 to the roll.\n4 Middle class is 6.5k each. So 26k.\n8 low berths are 700 each. So 5.6k.\nLet’s roll how many frozen passengers survive the trip:\nMedicine Routine 6+ check for each. +1 due to the ship being high TL.\nDone by Ithur, our medic with Medicine 3. All succeed.\nThe passengers should cover this month’s maintenance costs of 28k.\nRegarding cash, luckily none of the PCs starts with any debt, so we are at 182k with this new revenue.\nLet’s fill the cargo with some easy freight. We have 29 tons available.\nWe roll for availability of Major Lot, Minor Lot and Incidental Lot.\nMajor Lot:\n\nEffect of 8+ Broker or Streetwise. Tagon again. 7, Effect -1.\nMajor Lot DM-4\nFor Drinax DM-4 due to low population, +4 for high population of Pourne, so 0 total.\nBoth have A starports, so DM+2 each. +4\nBoth TL10+, so DM+2 each. +4.\nRoll 5 + 3=8. 3D lots. 7 lots available. Each is 1Dx10 tons. To keep rolling low, I’ll get the average at 3, so 30 tons. Can’t bring any of them.\nMinor Lot:\n15 tons each.\nSame rolls of before.\nTagon roll: 9. Effect 1.\nDM+9 total. 5D available. 15. I can bring only 1 at 15 tons.\nIncidental Lot:\n3 tons each.\nTogan roll: 10. Effect 2.\nDM+12 total thanks to Incidental DM+2. 29 lots\nAnother possible source of income is Mail delivery, which each container is 5 tons flat and brings 25k for each. There are 1D containers and all or nothing can be brough. Rolled 4, so 20 tons of mail for 100k. Easy win instead of cargo.\nSince this is 1 jump, freight brings 1k per ton. Freight is profitable for a small ship like mine only for a travel of at least 6 jumps.\nI will load the mail and 9 tons of incidental cargo, for 100k + 9k of profit.\n\n\nSo if we arrive at Pourne, 109k will wait for us. Didn’t expect cargo to scale so poorly compared to mail. Haven’t tried yet smuggling and speculative trading. Next time. At least I learned now that maintenance of ship and eventual crew is not going to be a big issue.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nNow to make the jump. I will not test for random stuff, I want to see the flow for now.\nOur newly mint privateers sail from the orbital palace and go to the edge of the system, where it’s safe to jump.\nPreparation of jump:\nAstrogation Easy 4+ check, with DM-1 being a 1 jump distance.\nTime for William. 2D + 2 Int + 2 Skill - 1 distance. 9. Success.\nFuel consumption is 10% of tonnage x jump parsecs. In this case, we have a total of 42 tons. The Harrier is 200 tons, so 20 tons per parsec. 20 tons in this case.\nEach jumps requires 1 week, regardless of distance. Jumping means being in a temporary universe of a bubble of hydrogen, so we are completely alone.\nSince the jump was good, we will come out near the target world already.\n\nDuring this week, each of the crew members will train on something, to be decided next session.

This is a Task Chain.\nWilliam time again. 2D + 5 + Int skill (0) + Engineer (j-drive) (2). 13. This is a success with more than 6 Effect, so an exceptional success.\nIn this case it’s just a good jump, so I would say that during travel the fuel consumption is better than expect, so I would say half of it.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nAt this point, I would say a new scene is in order.\nJump went well, so CF4.\nExpected scene: Travellers arrive at Pourne to investigate for ways to increase approval of Drinax\nCheck: 4.

No.\n\nAfter a brief communication with the docks of the highport, access is granted to an available dock.\nWhile docking, arrangements are made to discharge mails and passengers, hook up refueling to the Harrier (half cost to refill this time, so 5k).\nAfter a bit, docking is complete, everyone discharges and workers arrive, taking the mail containers. The funds are all accredited.\nSo we are at the highport.

Loudspeakers all around talk with a neutral and “corporate” voice, which is alternating between a feminine and a masculine one. The messages are all about keeping to himself, avoiding resistance to mandatory police checks. To ask for passage to planet-side, they remind everyone to follow the correct procedure to reach the public side of the capital. Failure to do so, will result in expedition to the penal colony on one of the gas giant moons.\nI guess the group wants to gather information around before going down to the ground.\n\n\n                   \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nFQ: Do they find anything?

So, they are not smuggling anything and the weapons are illegal only on planet-side, usually. I expect for this check to go smooth, but can give some talking points.\n\nSince the Harrier is seen here for the first time, a routine control is made. A group of 2 guards approach them, asking some questions and to come onboard the ship.\n\n\n                   \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nConversations: Meaningful, Plans\nPersonality: Attain, Danger\n\nThe lead officer starts asking general information about the ship and the plans of the group while berthed. He has a very serious look, with a not so hidden distrust for them.\n“We will be berthed for a few days before departing again. We are freelance traders and we resolve problems. Say, what is the procedure to reach the capital? We heard a lot of its beauty and we would love to visit.”, says Tagon.\n\n\n                   \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nMotivations table: Pleasure, Peace.\nI see where this is going.

Target is in a dangerous region.\nMmm.\n\nThe guard responds, behind his small moustache hiding a smirk.\n“You wish to see the city? The procedure is simple, you prove that you are not a menace to Pourne, you can go down the public side.”\n“I thought it was a… public place to go, y’ know.” Asks Jake.\n”Not today” snaps back the guard. “You first need to help here on the station. If I say so, you can then go down.”. The guard is smiling.\n“I have this spot the guards usually go to stretch after a long day’s work. Full of beautiful girls. But we go to keep an eye on the customers, it’s obvious. Thing is, one of our boys got carried away a couple of days ago and one of the girls felt really bad.\nShe couldn’t stomach some simple powder, you believe it? Ahahah”\n“Anyway, my friend got in trouble for that while the girl is back to work, as if nothing happened. Only his career is ruined, suspended for 3 whole months without pay! The bitch gotta pay. You ruin her, you get to do your joyful trip down and get also some credits fo the disturb. Good luck entering the private part of the club though, security is tight. Are you on?” Looking at the group.\nTagon replies, with another smirk “Of course, bitches… gonna suffer” and he looks at his companions with a complicit look. The others, catching on the drift, confirm as well.\n“Smart guys. The name’s Maeve Sullivan. Mine’s Edoth instead.”\nAfter the guard goes away, Tagon says: “Going to fuck up that asshole. Let’s go talk with Maeve and see what she knows.”\nEveryone starts walking in direction of the nightclub, no need to discuss.\nLet’s end here for today.\nI’ll make a new Mythic Adventure list for the Pourne System, to avoid mixing stuff."},"Solo-Games/Traveller---Pirates-of-Drinax/Session-2":{"title":"Session 2","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n[!Scene Setup]\nCF: 5.

I will add Edoth, Maeve and the Nightclub Owner as suspects, but Edoth will have a first clue already linked, since he is quite interested in creating trouble for Maeve and the other girls.\n\nThe group accepts to investigate the matter, citing “justice” as a motivation. Maeve has seen enough to know there is something more, but won’t refuse their help.\nThey try to get close to the remaining device from the theft.

I say Edoth.\n\nAfter Edoth has gone away, the group notices that the officer he was talking to quickly puts away a plastic container with open top, the one used for evidence storage.\nInside a very damaged red suit, dirtied by blood and some kind of grease with many holes in it, probably from laser shots.\nTagon asks about the suit.\n\n\n                   \n                  Tagon \n                  \n                \n“What happened and where did you find this red suit?”\n\nI don’t think he needs a check, since they have the official go to investigate.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nFQ: Does the officer refuse to collaborate? Unsure. 1, 5. 8. No.\n\nThe officer collaborates and explains what is available.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nWhere was found? Locations: Threatening, Artistic.\nWhat happened?\nActions: Betray, Agreement\nDescriptions: Powerfully, Comforting\n\nAccording to the report of another officer, a man in a red suit was found stealing some art pieces from a local art gallery of the highport. After cops intervention, they had to shoot him, but he is now currently at the hospital while receiving care.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nFQ: Does the report look fabricated? Likely, since it’s an interesting coincidence to have the man in red show up so soon. 9, 6. 18. Exceptional Yes. Nice.\nWhat is suspicious? Description table: Weak, Gently.\n\nGiven the data on the weight and height of the man, which seems to be quite low and unthreatening, some of the descriptions of the actions he did during the robbery seems quite exaggerated, like tackling a way bigger officer.\nThe group decides to visit the art gallery first to collect evidence, maybe something will be on Edoth or his men?\nAfter that, they will visit the man in red at the hospital.\nThey make sure to let the officers know of their investigation there, to avoid another false arrest.\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nScene Question: The PCs reach the art gallery, right? 7, equal to CF and Odd, so Altered Scene.\nCF decreases by 1 to 6.\nScene Adjustment Table: 7. Make 2 adjustments. Remove an Object and Increase an Activity.\nI would say, the object removed are their melee weapons that they are carrying upon entering. The activity increase will probably be a higher than expected presence of policemen.\n\nOnce they arrive there, the officers let them access the closed off building in the higher floors of the Pourne Space Station.\nThis place has a good view of the external part of the Station, which curves on both sides of where they are, creating a half moon shape, which grows in height the closer you are to the mid point.\nTo access though, they need to leave the melee weapons at the entrance, due to the high value of the objects inside.\nOnce obliged, they see a multi floor building full of art pieces from different parts of the known galaxy. Most of the space is taken by the Third Imperium pieces, but there are sections for all the Races.\nAll around, many officers go around, cataloguing all objects present even if there are no traces of damages anywhere.\nAfter being sent upstairs, they find the location of the theft.\n\n\n                   \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nWhat does the place look like?\nLocations: Impressive, Watery.\n\nThe floor that they reach is the most grandiose one, all covered in white marble and golden detail, be them baroque-style chandeliers, wall lights, gold-plated tables and chairs. On the walls, many paintings are shown. This is remarkably one of the Third Imperium spaces. All looks grandiose thanks also to a gigantic suspended aquarium that gives light and movement to everything around, thanks to the refracted light from the system’s star. If not for the absence of water all around, one would think of being underwater.\nThe traces of the theft are most visible in the absence of a glass on the part facing the void of space. In its place, a temporary metal lock has closed the loss of pressure. Some workers are cleaning up the broken glass and others are examining the damage to some sculptures and paintings near the broken window.\nWhat else is happening?\n\n\n                   \n                  Rolls \n                  \n                \nActions: Conceal Conflict\nDescriptions: Naturally Extravagant\nCharacter Actions General: Care Inspect\nObject: Threatening Bright\n\nWhile the workers are repairing the damage, some officers and a couple of what seems to be directors, are intently examining and discussing about a specific art piece.\nWhat seems to be a high tech plasma flashlight with some extravagant colouring, modified to act simultaneously as a homemade plasma ejector, similar to a raw plasma shotgun with a very limited range but great stopping power.\nOn its side the words “The Imperium” are hand written."},"Star-Wars-Campaign/Campaign-Status-Doc/Adventure-1/Adventure-1-PUM":{"title":"Adventure 1 PUM","links":["Plot_Unfolding_Machine_v8_final.pdf"],"tags":["excalidraw"],"content":"⚠  Switch to EXCALIDRAW VIEW in the MORE OPTIONS menu of this document. ⚠\nText Elements §\nWhy building the kyber droids?

Read and implement here if more interesting than mystery matrix:\nhttp://jonwake.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-social-crawl-part-1.html?m=1\nGames to play:\n\n Blades in the Dark\n\n Use Alone in the Dark, fallback to Mythic if needed.\n\n\n Sci-Fantasy / Space Opera\n\n Scum &amp; Villainy / Starforged / SWN / Traveller / ICRPG\n Star Wars rebels with a starship\n Star Wars bounty hunter (using Mystery Matrix for bounty tracking)\n\n\n Wicked Ones\n Wicked Ones Zombies (Left 4 Dead style as director, maybe in fantasy setting? Modern ok too)\n High powered fantasy with Godbound\n Shadow of the Demon Lord\n\n Demonic Solo Rules for it\n\n\n Test Tricube Tales with Mythic and with its solo rules\n\n TT solo rules seem geared towards one shots\n Use micro settings. The dwarf apocalypse one is interesting.\n\n\n Do a campaign in a world created using WWN factions &amp; campaign creation rules\n\n Could be used with WWN, TT, Shadow of the Demon Lord or other cases without predefined settings\n Microscope could be used for it too, but more for zooming in on things.\n\n Can be used as a way to jump in mini adventures in a single world across time\n\n\n\n\n Ironsworn with a more fantasy setting?\n\n Use Arcanum: High Magic for Ironsworn for a magic system, on DTRPG\n\n\n Try some post apocalyptic\n\n Glow in the Dark?\n Tricube Tales?\n Other Dust\n\n\n Cyberpunk?\n\n Tricube Tales\n Hack the Planet\n CWN\n\n\n W40K + Mythic\n\n There are multiple stories that can be cool.\n Space Marine adventure\n Guardsmen\n Scum hive gang stuff, could work also with Blades or some cyberpunk game though\n Investigation Tier 1-2 play\n Ork adventure\n Try using the premade adventure, look at other approaches to run them apart from Mythic article.

The concept could be used simplified, in the end it duplicates normal combat with different stats.\n\n Simple Intrigue are one-check rolls like for normal persuasion etc, for short term stuff\n Standard Intrigue is a social battle, each turn you choose your technique (persuasion, seduction, lies…), use your specific stats for each and bring down the Composure (HP). At 0, you convinced the other person. The one that did most damage convinces if multiple people are participating. Each participant needs an objective stated at start.\n Complex Intrigues are longer intrigues with different Standard Intrigues going on with time. Useful for long term stuff.\n\n\n System is a bit crunchy, maybe it can be simplified with Myhic Questions when needed. Look also at Burning Wheel, has social combat as well, but more famous, maybe it’s faster?\n\n Court of Blades\n Kingdom could be used for that\n Torchbearer, uses same system as Burning Wheel\n\n\n\n\n Fantasy AGE\n Dark Eye\n Against the Darkmaster\n\n It’s kinda LoTR style\n\n\n Iron in the Blood (vampire living the ages based on Ironsworn)\n\n\n Wargaming / Hybrid boardgames\n\n

The oracle responds, “Bloodied Banishment.”\nInterpreting these keywords, you envision this settlement’s grim method of enacting justice. Anyone sentenced to death for a crime is taken to the ruins. There, under the fading light of the setting sun, they are bloodied by the quick slash of a ceremonial blade. Finally, they are chained to an altar within the central courtyard. The foul creatures who dwell in that place do the rest._\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: 1d100Description1 - 2Deep3 - 4Tainted5 - 6Grey7 - 8Forgotten9 - 10Flooded11 - 12Forbidden13 - 14Barren15 - 16Lost17 - 18Cursed19 - 20Fell21 - 22Sunken23 - 24Nightmare25 - 26Infernal27 - 28Dark29 - 30Bloodstained31 - 32Haunted33 - 34White35 - 36Shrouded37 - 38Wasted39 - 40Grim41 - 42Endless43 - 44Crumbling45 - 46Undying47 - 48Bloodied49 - 50Forsaken51 - 52Silent53 - 54Blighted55 - 56Iron57 - 58Frozen59 - 60Abyssal61 - 62Crimson63 - 64Silver65 - 66Desecrated67 - 68Ashen69 - 70Elder71 - 72Scorched73 - 74Unknown75 - 76Scarred77 - 78Broken79 - 80Chaotic81 - 82Black83 - 84Hidden85 - 86Sundered87 - 88Shattered89 - 90Dreaded91 - 92Secret93 - 94High95 - 96Sacred97 - 98Fallen99 - 100Ruined^IronswornOraclesSiteNameDescription\nDetail §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: 1d100Detail1 - 2Blight3 - 4Strife5 - 6Nightfall7 - 8Fury9 - 10Terror11 - 12Truth13 - 14Spring15 - 16Sanctuary17 - 18Bone19 - 20Specters21 - 22Daybreak23 - 24Doom25 - 26Treachery27 - 28Blood29 - 30War31 - 32Torment33 - 34Iron35 - 36Silence37 - 38Mist39 - 40Isolation41 - 42Runes43 - 44Rot45 - 46Corruption47 - 48Prophecy49 - 50Fate51 - 52Twilight53 - 54Power55 - 56Darkness57 - 58Gloom59 - 60Storms61 - 62Hope63 - 64Lament65 - 66Frost67 - 68Souls69 - 70Winter71 - 72Sadness73 - 74Desolation75 - 76Bane77 - 78Lies79 - 80Ash81 - 82Banishment83 - 84Shadow85 - 86Madness87 - 88Stone89 - 90Secrets91 - 92Despair93 - 94Blades95 - 96Dread97 - 98Light99 - 100Wrath^IronswornOraclesSiteNameDetail\nNamesake §\n_You may also use your preferred name randomizer to generate a Namesake for your site.\nIf you want to add details for the Namesake, use the Character oracles in Ironsworn Core (page 182).

Then, follow the structure of the template to build the name from individual tables. If you’ve already set the faction type, picking from the tables (instead of rolling) will likely provide a more appropriate result. For example, “Silver Jackals” is a fitting name for a criminal organization. The “Empire of the Undying Suns” is a less apt name for that gang—unless their leader is prone to delusions of grandeur. In short, choosing a name will give you more control. Rolling might give you a result that doesn’t square with known aspects, but those contradictions may prove inspiring.\nAn alternative approach to generating a faction from scratch is to start with a random name. Then, consider what the name evokes and choose an appropriate faction type instead of rolling on those tables. For example, “Bloody Ravens” might suggest a mercenary guild, while the “Republic of the Radiant Servants” brings to mind a dominion built upon a religion, or one that idolizes a prophesied leader. If a result doesn’t inspire anything interesting, roll again or pick._\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: 1d100NameTemplate1 - 40`dice: [[StarforgedOracleTables#^41 - 55`dice: [[StarforgedOracleTables#^56 - 70`dice: [[StarforgedOracleTables#^71 - 100`dice: [[StarforgedOracleTables#^^FactionsNameTemplate\nLegacy §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: 1d100Legacy1 - 2Ancient3 - 4Ashen5 - 6Awakened7 - 8Azure9 - 10Blessed11 - 12Bloody13 - 14Broken15 - 16Ceaseless17 - 18Crimson19 - 20Cursed21 - 22Dawning23 - 24Dissident25 - 26Ebon27 - 28Elder29 - 30Enduring31 - 32Enlightened33 - 34Exalted35 - 36Fallen37 - 38Fated39 - 40First41 - 42Forgotten43 - 44Forsaken45 - 46Gloaming47 - 48Golden49 - 50Hidden51 - 52Infernal53 - 54Infinite55 - 56Iron57 - 58Kindred59 - 60Obsidian61 - 62Radiant63 - 64Risen65 - 66Sacred67 - 68Sapphire69 - 70Scarlet71 - 72Serene73 - 74Shattered75 - 76Shining77 - 78Silent79 - 80Silver81 - 82Sovereign83 - 84Stellar85 - 86Sundered87 - 88Supreme89 - 90Undying91 - 92Unified93 - 94United95 - 96Universal97 - 98Veiled99 - 100Wandering^FactionsLegacy\nAffiliation §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: 1d100Affiliation1 - 4Accord5 - 8Alliance9 - 12Ascendancy13 - 16Circle17 - 20Coalition21 - 24Collective25 - 28Commonwealth29 - 32Confederation33 - 36Consortium37 - 40Council41 - 44Court45 - 48Covenant49 - 52Dominion53 - 56Empire57 - 60Federation61 - 64Imperium65 - 68League69 - 72Legion73 - 76Order77 - 80Pact81 - 84Regiment85 - 88Republic89 - 92Sphere93 - 96Syndicate97 - 100Union^FactionsAffiliation\nIdentity §\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndice: 1d100Identity1 - 2Blades3 - 4Builders5 - 6Daggers7 - 8Defenders9 - 10Disciples11 - 12Domains13 - 14Drifters15 - 16Embers17 - 18Flames19 - 20Fleet21 - 22Guardians23 - 24Hammers25 - 26Harbingers27 - 28Heralds29 - 30Hounds31 - 32Hunters33 - 34Jackals35 - 36Keepers37 - 38Knights39 - 40Menders41 - 42Outcasts43 - 44Phantoms45 - 46Planets47 - 48Raiders49 - 50Ravens51 - 52Realms53 - 54Reavers55 - 56Relics57 - 58Seekers59 - 60Sentinels61 - 62Serpents63 - 64Servants65 - 66Shadows67 - 68Shards69 - 70Skulls71 - 72Souls73 - 74Specters75 - 76Stars77 - 78Suns79 - 80Swarm81 - 82Swords83 - 84Talons85 - 86Vanguards87 - 88Wardens89 - 90Watchers91 - 92Wolves93 - 94Worlds95 - 96Wraiths97 - 98Wreckers99 - 100Wrights^FactionsIdentity\nQuirks §\nRoll or pick known characteristics of the faction and its members using this table.

This infrastructure may be the result of a still-functional Working, or it could be the product of some venerable occult engine that’s still operational, or it may be the fruit of the labors of some specially-designed organism or Blighted populace.\nE\nAbusive ruler overusing the infrastructure, Foreign agent seeking to cause havoc, Reckless sorcerer seeking to steal its power\nF\nHarried chief of the maintainers, Fascinated foreign scholar, Merchant reliant on its use\nC\nThe infrastructure’s cruelly-costly maintenance is coming up, The infrastructure is starting to fray, The infrastructure was actually meant for a much more sinister purpose\nT\nIrreplaceable infrastructure component, Spare parts worth vast sums on the market, Secret artifact that can control the infrastructure\nP\nDangerously energetic working zone, Secret hideout inside the infrastructure, Sanctified and holy control center\nBlood Feud §\nTwo or more groups of citizens within the community hate each other. Their neighbors or the local law have kept things from too-overt violence, but members of the groups will constantly interfere with their rivals and cause whatever misery they can get away with. This hate may spring from recent events, or it may be an inherited spite from old wrongs.\nE\nWholly unsympathetic group leader, Schemer seeking to exploit the feud, Ruler going to brutal excess to tamp it down\nF\nReluctant participant in the feud, Local digging for the real truth of the quarrel, Merchant who’d profit by a new peace\nC\nThe groups were formerly the closest of allies, One group is favored by local rulers, One side is getting completely out of hand\nT\nA treasure the groups are fighting over, Object of exculpating evidence, Lost symbol of peaceful unity\nP\nBloody back alleyway, Sabotaged business, Group-dominated tavern\nBad Neighbors §\nThe community has a conflict with a neighboring community. This usually isn’t part of a larger war, but is instead a personal animosity between them. It may be the community has suffered at their enemy’s hands, or they may have been the ones applying the suffering. Constant low-level skirmishes and troublemaking go on between the two.\nE\nForeign lord profiting by the quarrel, Bitter zealot who demands violent action, Real culprit seeking to hide their offense\nF\nDespairing peacemaker of a shared faith, Local with family from the rival, Frustrated but helpless ruler\nC\nOne side seems at fault but is actually less blameworthy, The rulers of both use the quarrel to distract their populace, It was a minor dispute that is spiraling out of control\nT\nProof of the culprit’s guilt, Weapons cache meant to start real bloodshed, Treasure that would erase the cause of the dispute\nP\nDangerous no-man’s-land between the communities, Burnt home of a sympathizer, Religious festival turned into a semi-riot\nBrilliant Innovation §\nSome local has come up with a wonderful new idea; it may be a magical innovation, a new industrial process, a new agricultural product, a new use for what was thought to be ancient garbage, or some other very useful, profitable idea. Everyone around them is fighting for the chance to exploit this clever new plan.\nE\nGrasping guildmaster, Overbearing local ruler, Local leader whose power is threatened by the innovation\nF\nVisionary supporter of the innovator, Outside merchant seeking to profit by enabling the innovation, Local leader whose constituency would profit from it\nC\nThe innovation requires ingredients only adventurers can get, The innovation is riskier than it seems, The innovator is actually a con artist\nT\nCritical component for the innovation, Trove of profit from the innovation’s test run, Vital planning and design documents\nP\nAmbitious test zone for the innovation, Guildhall of upset locals, Tavern with locals fighting over the change\nBroken Spirits §\nThe locals are in a state of despair and dull apathy. They’ve lost the things that used to give them pride and hope, with the best among them carrying on out of habitual duty and the worst giving ready hands to shameful deeds and ignoble acts. No one really believes the future can be better, and most seek only to satisfy immediate appetites.\nE\nCruel tyrant who broke them, Slaver trading on the hopeless, Merchant of despair and its costly escapes\nF\nDetermined young local leader, Proud old rememberer of better days, Furious rebel against the world\nC\nAn outside power wants to keep them safely broken, Their fall was due to their own sins and errors, They could be very dangerous if they regain their spirit\nT\nSymbolic item of former glory, Resources to kick-start a new source of pride, Treasure laid up in splendid times\nP\nCrumbling monument to a past victory, “Wealthy” town area that’s shabby and ill-kept, Empty temple to a once-loved god\nCriminal Bosses §\nOne or more crime bosses have a powerful influence on the community. They may control crime within the community itself, or they may use it simply as a safe haven from which to direct their minions elsewhere. Local law enforcement may know all about them, but lack the strength to confront them and their paid or intimidated henchmen.\nE\nBlatantly overt criminal chief, Well-controlled head of law enforcement, Crime boss bent on using the PCs as catspaws\nF\nVictim of an untouchable boss, Determined bounty hunter, Ambitious criminal seeking to make room above\nC\nThe crime boss’ support is what keeps the community prosperous, Local government is almost openly staffed by cartel members, The locals will deal with PC troublemakers for fear of the boss’ anger\nT\nA boss’ secret stash of wealth, A treasure stolen elsewhere and brought here by a boss, Evidence proving one boss is betraying another\nP\nUncharacteristically opulent home in the slums, Sleepy law enforcement headquarters, Dangerous tavern for local minions\nCorrupt Laws §\nWhat law exists here is for sale, or does not apply to certain favored groups or castes. While some degree of corruption and noble license exists almost everywhere, this community lacks any shred of impartiality. Strangers might be fleeced by local lawmen, evildoers can be absolved by a payment, and powerful gentry do as they please.\nE\nImmensely venal magistrate, Local lord who fails to see any problem with the “natural” order, Crime boss taking blatant advantage of the corruption\nF\nA crusading law enforcer, Royal investigating censor, Victim of a cruel injustice\nC\nThe favored class are vital to the community’s security, The natives would rather pay predictable bribes than risk facing real justice, The real law is enforced by a secret group of natives\nT\nAn uncollected pile of bribe money, Stolen goods yet unsold, Blackmail evidence on the chief magistrate\nP\nA courtroom where the law is sold, Crime scene with an unconcerned criminal, Site of brutal vigilante justice\nCultural Center §\nThe community produces some wonderful cultural artifact or trains famous artists. The product might be some exceptional cloth, or artistic luxury good, or the scholarly fruits of a famous academy. Trained artists might be students of a particular school, or the apprentices of the current masters of a long artistic tradition who dwell here.\nE\nMaster artist who suffers no rivals, “Visionary” who wants to tear down the old art for their own new one, Merchant who is trying to control the production for profit\nF\nAmbitious young artist of profound talent, Wild genius of very difficult temperament, Aged master proud of his tradition\nC\nThe art requires resources that are running low, Some other group is cheaply and poorly mimicking the art, Their main market has somehow been cut off\nT\nA famous and ancient work of art, An art object made of some priceless substance, An art object encoded with a precious secret\nP\nBusy studio or academy hall, Mercantile emporium where the cultural products are traded, Renegade artist’s hovel\nCursed Circumstances §\nThe community has been cursed with some blight that makes life difficult, albeit not impossible. An offended sorcerer’s vengeful Working, an outraged god’s wrath, a local distortion of the Legacy, or a simple history of bad feng shui in the area may have brought the curse about. If you include this tag, you’ll want to devise not only the curse, but the reason why the locals haven’t left for better lands.\nE\nCharlatan offering false hope, Local demagogue blaming a useful culprit, Native profiting from the curse\nF\nScholar seeking details of the blight, Stubborn curse survivor, Aspiring curse-lifter with a secret weapon\nC\nIt has a profitable side effect, It was meant to be a blessing, It can be aimed by willing conspirators\nT\nA personal anti-curse ward, Hidden wealth of a curse victim, A means to lift the curse\nP\nEnterprise blighted by the curse, Festival held to pray for mercy, Ruin of a curse victim’s home\nDecaying Working §\nA great magical Working has been a critical part of the community since its creation, but now it’s beginning to decay. It may function only intermittently, now, or its effects may have curdled into something double-edged. The locals have no idea how to fix it, and indeed, it may not be possible to repair it with modern knowledge of sorcery.\nE\nSaboteur from an enemy community, Scavenger stealing critical components, Overconfident wizard attempting a ruinous repair\nF\nOne of the Working’s hereditary keepers, Native dependent on the Working’s effects, Desperate researcher of repairs\nC\nPart of the community would greatly profit by the Working’s failure, The Working risks catastrophic eruption, The rulers punish any talk of it failing\nT\nA critical repair text for the Working, Valuable broken Working components, Precious resources crystallized from the Working’s energies\nP\nControl nexus for the Working, Enterprise dependent on the Working, Site of a Working failure or accident\nDecadent Locals §\nThe locals enjoy repulsive vices and shameful appetites. They may have religious sanction for their evils, or neighbors might trade with them for such things, or they could be followers of some ideology that blesses such pursuits. Their economy or their social organization is usually heavily reliant on such traffic, and to ensure its continuance they may have made bargains with things worse than humans.\nE\nTrader in hideous sins, Bored gentry in search of a cruel thrill, Once-prey that has become an even worse predator\nF\nLocal who has secret doubts about the vice, Crusader from outside, Escaped victim seeking vengeance\nC\nThe victims of the vice are a class or type that their neighbors don’t care about in the slightest, They have ways to make their vices give them power, Their society is attractive aside from this hideous urge\nT\nA stolen victim of great value to someone else, Proof of an outside noble’s trade with them, Precious regalia used in the vice\nP\nSalon of hideous beauty, Stinking slave pit, Mundane locale of ordinary business tainted by their evil\nDemihuman Populace §\nA particular breed of demihuman are either the majority here or have the dominant positions in the community. Architecture, local laws, and social customs are all tuned to suit them, and they may not be particularly forgiving or friendly to humans. Communities that are not outright independent usually make an arm’s-length submission to a local lord.\nE\nDemihuman official who grudges baselines, Baseline local who grudges the demihumans, Outsider preying on the demihumans\nF\nCurious young native, Canny local diplomat to humans, Native with a need for baseline help\nC\nTheir human suzerain wants to erase all independence from them, Something’s legal here that’s forbidden in baseline communities but natural to them, Their independence is enforced with something they have\nT\nPrecious demihuman-made goods, Ancient relic revered by the natives, Wealth of a prosperous outside trader\nP\nHoly site forbidden to humans, House built to demihuman preferences, Business unique to demihuman needs\nDueling Lords §\nTwo different major powers are fighting over control of the community. Two rival lords, a baron and a merchant-price, the mayor and a local high priest, or some other combination struggle to achieve dominance. They may both have justifiable claim on running the community, or one may be a greedy interloper.\nE\nThird party profiting by the strife, Traitor to one of the rivals, Outsider vulture wanting both rivals to fail\nF\nHarried local peacemaker, Impotent judge appointed by a disinterested higher authority. Appealing partisan of one rival\nC\nThe rival with the most legitimate claim is the least suitable to rule, A vital civic task is left undone until a ruler is determined, Both rivals have terrible plans\nT\nToken of legitimate rule, Bribe meant for a powerful local, Proof of a rival’s malfeasance\nP\nDeadlocked city hall, Site of mob violence between rival groups, Tavern full of well-armed partisans\nFaded Remnant §\nThis community used to be much larger and more prosperous, but something happened relatively long ago that left it a shrunken shadow of its former self. Only a tithe of citizens remain on the site, and much of its former architecture is crumbling and abandoned. A few weathered tokens of old glory remain, and some may be jealously maintained, but there simply aren’t enough locals left to keep up what they’ve inherited.\nE\nLooter seeking to plunder the remains, Zealot with a plan to return to glory, Outsider strongman who wants to coerce the locals into obedience\nF\nLearned scholar of the noble past, Hard-scrabble present survivor, New citizen who sees hope in the place\nC\nThey don’t fully understand what they’ve inherited, They were crushed because of their past evils, They’re not the actual heirs but merely squatters who moved into the empty place\nT\nArtifact of the prior golden age, Wealth hidden away long ago, Secret key to unlocking new glory\nP\nNear-abandoned city center, Massive decaying monument, Partially fallen town wall\nEnemy Within §\nThe locals are convinced that there is some terrible threat against them working from within their society. It may be a matter of dark sorcerers, foreign spies, traitorous neighbors, shapeshifting monsters, or some other hidden evil. This evil may be a recent fear, or it may be an inherited peril they’ve always had to guard against. The danger itself may or may not exist, or if it exists it may not justify the steps being taken.\nE\nLocal inquisitor targeting his personal enemies, Leader of the sinister evil, Traitorous local in service to the evil\nF\nUnjustly accused victim, Local ruler trying to restrain the mob, Skilled and discerning hunter of the evil\nC\nThe evil is real but actually running the inquisition, The hunters are creating the evil whether intentionally or no, The evil really is exactly as bad as the hunters say it is\nT\nConfession naming perpetrators of the evil, Wealth taken from condemned sinners, Resources gathered by the agents of the evil\nP\nConfiscated home of an evildoer, Public execution site for the wicked, Courtroom where the evil is being tried\nFallen Prosperity §\nThe community used to be much richer, but something happened recently to crush its source of prosperity. Different factions of the community might be trying to grasp at the remaining dregs of wealth, others might try to restart the failed industry, and some might look for a new livelihood. Any group or entity thought responsible for the collapse is likely to be treated very harshly, and some locals might find profit in shifting the blame to their enemies.\nE\nOutside profiteer squeezing the newly-poor, Local monopolizing the remaining income, Demagogue blaming everything on their enemy\nF\nPlucky local trying to make a new go of things, Harried disburser of limited charity, Riches-to-rags native trying to maintain their dignity\nC\nTheir loss is a rival’s gain, Someone’s offering them a new industry at a terrible price, The leadership is refusing to accept the new reality\nT\nPriceless relic of their former wealth, Supplies vital to a budding industry, Resources once held lightly that now are very precious here\nP\nIll-maintained but splendid public building, Mansion marked by genteel poverty, Empty shop once catering to the rich\nForeign Enclave §\nEither most or a substantial minority of the locals are descended from foreigners alien to their local neighbors. They may have been religious exiles, economic migrants, indigenous locals surrounded by the existing polity, or a foreign city conquered within the relatively recent past. The locals may not be enthusiastic about being ruled by others not of their kind, and their neighbors may look askance at the way foreign customs or even laws may be maintained.\nE\nRuthless independence fighter, Outsider ruler with no regard for the locals, Local grandee preaching contempt for outsider ways\nF\nPeacemaking local leader, Local in love with an outsider, Pragmatic-minded outsider magistrate\nC\nSecessionists are being supported by their co-ethnics, The polity’s leaders don’t want them here, They’re hated by their co-ethnics for some reason\nT\nPrecious relic brought from the homeland, Wealth hidden away for fear of outsiders, Valuable good made as a cultural tradition\nP\nPublic building in an aggressively different architectural style, Outsider home surrounded by local-style buildings, Civic gathering place of a kind specific to the locals\nHeavy Fortification §\nThe community is remarkably well-fortified for a site of its size and role. Tall, stout walls, strongpoints inside the community, concentric defenses, a strategic terrain location, or a large body of standing troops might be present. Some threat is thought to exist that makes maintaining this fortification worthwhile, though it may come at a dear cost to the locals. The community’s suzerain may be uncomfortable with these defenses, as they could just as easily be used to defy the ruler.\nE\nOutside enemy seeking to pierce the defenses, Rebel trying to declare independence, Heavy-handed local ruler demanding protection money\nF\nIndustrious maintenance chief, Ruler’s appointed local military commander, Local warning of some sudden impending danger\nC\nThe threat is gone but those who profit by the defenses keep them going, The defenses are impractical, The community can no longer bear the expense of the defenses\nT\nComponents of a powerful fixed weapon, Payroll for the soldiers, Precious and specialized maintenance components\nP\nOversized weapon emplacement, Top of a looming city wall, Stronghold keep at the center of the community\nGuild Oligarchy §\nWhile the community might ostensibly be ruled by some other power, real control lies with the senior members of the local craft and labor guilds. Their decisions have the practical weight of law, and much of their time and effort is spent squeezing out competitors and parceling out economic opportunities in the community. Some guilds might have little or nothing to do with their original trade, and now exist purely as shells for political influence.\nE\nProfoundly corrupt guild boss, Ambitious newcomer with brutal methods, Ruthless leader of a guild of criminals\nF\nHard-bitten elder among the workers, Outsider trying to make room here, Reformer seeking to oust the corrupt guild heads\nC\nThe guilds have intermarried or entangled themselves with the ostensible rulers, The guilds offer protection from a real or imagined threat, They guilds hate each other only slightly less than the competition\nT\nPriceless symbolic guild regalia, Wealth hidden by the former ruler of the community, Money earned by shady business practices\nP\nBustling guild hall, Purely decorative ruler’s court, Shabby worker’s housing\nHidden Ruler §\nWhile the community has a public leader, the real authority is hidden from outsiders. This ruler may draw their authority from rationales unacceptable to outsiders, they may have cowed the public authority into obedience, or they may have a mutually beneficial private arrangement with the official ruler.\nE\nSecret cult-backed leader, Nefarious agent of an enemy power, Minor functionary who is actually the hidden master\nF\nFrustrated outside authority, Local seeking better government, Victim of the hidden leader’s will\nC\nMost people know that the real authority is concealed, The hidden ruler is a mortal enemy of the legitimate authority, The hidden ruler’s effective authority is over a large affiliated group rather than the whole community\nT\nInformation on the hidden government, Bribe money paid to the public authority, Blackmail material on important locals\nP\nUnassuming tavern that’s a secret headquarters, Tense court of the official ruler, Hidden site where the secret government meets\nHostile Terrain §\nThe community is surrounded by dangerous terrain: miasmatic swamps, perilous crevasses, radioactive badlands, a pocket of arratu, or some other harmful topography. The community might prefer the defensive potential of the terrain here, or have found a precious resource worth the danger. The terrain might have formed at some time since the founding, with the citizens struggling to make terms with the new danger.\nE\nBandit chief hiding in the terrain, Monstrous leader in the badlands, Local who’s made a secret deal with the terrain’s vile inhabitants\nF\nCanny badland guide, Innocent researcher eager to explore, Grizzled chief engineer of the community’s anti-terrain measures\nC\nThe terrain is growing somehow, The terrain offers some special profit as well as danger, The community is being crushed by the terrain\nT\nTreasure lost within the terrain, Device that generates or protects against the terrain, Precious resource found within the terrain\nP\nEdge of the community overtaken by the environment, Building fortified against the terrain, Tavern favored by terrain guides and explorers\nInherited Architecture §\nMany of the community’s structures date back to the ancient past and a long-vanished culture. They have unique architectural traits, perhaps being made of some strange substance or with uncanny qualities. The locals find them too useful or too durable to destroy, but the buildings often have unpleasant little surprises in their under-explored corners, and there may be greater structures still buried by long ages beneath the community’s streets.\nE\nA Thing from Below, Outside pillager bent on sacking the structures, Reckless explorer opening up things best left sealed\nF\nHeir to the ancient arts of maintenance, Chief of the local structure guard patrol, Keeper of a particularly useful structure\nC\nThe locals mine treasures from the buried depths, The structures were built by Outsiders, They require dark sacrifices to keep functioning\nT\nKey to unlock a sealed structure, Artifact of the ancient lost people, Map to a hidden structure\nP\nMundane business in a remarkable building, Ancient structure retrofitted into a habitation, Buried ancient street within a cavern\nIncompetent Leaders §\nThe community is led by one or more incompetents. While they must have been very good at something to have acquired the position, they are fundamentally incapable of leading. Uncontrolled passions or lusts, commitment to a hopelessly impractical ideal, pig-headed obstinacy in the face of failure, a total lack of charisma or interpersonal skills, or profound laziness might all unfit them for their post.\nE\nHeir who is totally unsuited to their new rule, Disinterested ruler forced on them by their overlord, Charismatic ninny with ridiculous plans\nF\nDeposed former leader, Desperate local elder, Victim of one of their bungled plans\nC\nAn outside rival is backing the fool, The idiot has tremendous institutional legitimacy, They provide a critical skill or ability unrelated to ruling\nT\nEmbezzled funds from a failed plan, Precious artifact lost through incompetence, Regalia of critical importance to the ruler’s legitimacy\nP\nChaotic and ill-kept court, Site of abject disaster, Plaza full of grumbling locals\nInhuman Cooperation §\nThe locals have a deal with some manner of inhuman power, either remnant Outsiders, eldritch entities, nearby monstrous beings, or some other creature generally feared or hated by humans. It may actually be a peaceful exchange, but more likely it involves acts and sacrifices that other humans would refuse. If not secret, this deal is valuable enough to make the community’s suzerain avert their eyes, or it may be a bargain so old that time has sanctified it to their neighbors.\nE\nSinister overseer of the bargain’s price, Local magnate growing rich off the dark bargain, Alien entity seeking to expand the terms of the deal\nF\nVictim of the bargain’s price, Outside investigator seeking the truth, Inveterate hunter of the entity’s type come to purge the evil\nC\nThe bargain is actually reasonably fair and decent, The locals don’t want the bargain but their neighbors profit by it and so force them into it, However bad the creatures are they’re actually better than the human lord\nT\nValuable alien goods, Wealth offered as a sacrifice, Treasure gained by cooperation\nP\nSecret meeting hall for the creatures, Prosperous front business, Sinister ritual of sacrifice\nLawless Class §\nSome class of citizen is either tacitly or explicitly above the law. They may only be subject to punishment for crimes against their own kind, or they may be entirely immune to legal prosecution. In some cases, this immunity may be the product of official indifference rather than high status; some untouchable classes may be considered so lowly that their slaughter of each other isn’t worth punishing unless it inconveniences their betters.\nE\nProfessionally immune provocateur, Cruelly indulgent elite, Grasping mercantile oligarch\nF\nHapless magistrate, Avenger outside the law, Victim of an unpunishable crime\nC\nThe lawless themselves enforce the law, The immune are most dangerous to each other, Special servants of the immune also are immune\nT\nWealth stolen from a hapless victim, Evidence that an abuser is not legitimately part of the class, Token that grants the bearer the same immunity\nP\nCourtroom where some cases are swiftly dismissed, Site of a gaudily obvious exercise of immunity, Shop where the business was ruined by their excesses\nMagical Academy §\nWhile private tutelage of worthy apprentices can sometimes be had even in remote villages, this community is unusual in that it has an actual school dedicated to teaching magic. Such schools are usually small, with no more than a few dozen pupils, most of whom will fail for lack of talent or discipline. The instructors are rarely first-rate, usually serving only for the pay and status, but sometimes a genius sorcerer will find a reason to observe likely apprentices here. Given the unfortunate accident potential of the school, it’s probably isolated or well-fortified.\nE\nAmoral headmaster, Secretly monstrous school patron, Unpleasantly talented yet vicious elite student\nF\nPlucky young apprentice, Harried but earnest teacher, Instructor with useful side obsession\nC\nThe academy is patronized by the ruling class, The community grew around the academy, The rulers don’t trust the wizards but find them too useful to get rid of them\nT\nLong-lost grimoire of power, Brilliant artifice of a genius student, Magical key to a dark power the academy keeps locked up\nP\nBattered magical laboratory, Architecturally impossible chamber, Grubby student lodgings\nMartial Tradition §\nThe natives have a long tradition of martial expertise. This may be a crisply-organized history of skilled native levies, or it may be a natural belligerence in the people that leaves them familiar with bloodshed. While their neighbors and liege doubtless respect their talents, this very aptitude might make them more willing to turn to steel than prudence would advise.\nE\nRuthlessly amoral military leader, Obsessive martial academy master, Outsider using the locals as brute muscle\nF\nDetermined local defender, Petitioner in need of their prowess, Keeper of the local martial way\nC\nThey use weapons only they are able to employ, They’ve bled themselves white in gaining glory, They’re eager to conquer their neighbors\nT\nEnchanted weapon related to their way, Plunder taken in a victorious war, Venerated battle harness of a legendary hero\nP\nBusy training ground, Cemetery with many memorials, City hall decorated with the banners of the vanquished\nMistreated Blighted §\nNot all Blighted are violent; many are simply cursed with disabilities or mental compulsions implanted in them by their creators. The locals here have a useful kind of Blighted that provides some valuable service; brute labor, companionship, or more awful fates for those with precious organic components. The locals treat them as nothing but expendable chattel, but the Blighted are unable to effectively defend themselves or survive without the support of their tormentors.\nE\nBloodless local slaver, Faux-benevolent overseer, Reformer seeking a complete purge of them\nF\nBlighted leader, Troubled local, Native seeking to take over the work niche the Blighted are filling\nC\nThe Blighted are emotionally addicted to this kind of servitude, The Blighted could be very dangerous if they got free, Criminals and the unwanted are transformed into the Blighted\nT\nDevice that imposes the Blight on a victim, Wealth earned by Blighted suffering, Key to the method used to control the Blighted\nP\nWorkhouse full of cruelly-used Blighted, Stately mansion with rigidly-disciplined Blighted servants, Sinister establishment staffed by disposable Blighted\nMiserable Penury §\nLife is hard in the Latter Earth, but it is exceptionally hard here. People are deprived of all but the barest necessities, and even the local gentry are impoverished compared to their peers elsewhere. Something is making the locals stay, however, whether fear of the alternative, hope for a better future, or a stubborn attachment to their ancestral lands.\nE\nRapacious beggar-lord oppressing even poorer lessers, Outsider who’s siphoning off wealth, Brutal gang leader determined to take what they want\nF\nPlucky young entrepreneur, Charitable cleric, Suzerain’s envoy seeking to improve things\nC\nThey could be richer if they abandon a defining cultural tradition, They’re being bled dry by outsiders, They’re hopelessly resigned\nT\nA stash of wealth that would be minor elsewhere, Desperately needed resources, A cherished relic that had to be sold for survival’s sake\nP\nMiserable slum of shanties, Unprofitable fields, Tavern with only the barest minimum of fare\nMonstrous Tribute §\nThe locals have cut a deal with some unspeakable entity, trading some vile tribute in exchange for the being’s forbearance or assistance. Outsiders may be ignorant of the bargain, or they may know that the community is in thrall but be too fearful of its master to take action against them. The creature likely serves as a protector as well as a tyrant, so the locals may be content with the deal even if it doesn’t offer any further inducement or aid.\nE\nAncient artificial intellect-tyrant, Cruel sorcerer-lord, Monstrous quasi-god\nF\nSecret rebel against the deal, Investigator looking for evidence, Monstrous rival of the tyrant\nC\nThey seize the tribute from their neighbors or enemies, The deal is getting progressively worse, Their neighbors are thinking of making their own deals\nT\nRitual instruments forged via atrocity, Forbidden book of hideous truths, Precious resource generated by the entity\nP\nSecret shrine to their unholy master, Prison where the tribute is kept, Bustling town street full of sinister prosperity\nNeglectful Ruler §\nThe community can’t rely on its ostensible suzerain. Whatever lord claims ownership of the place is indifferent to its troubles and pays no attention to its civic disorder. The lord may be incapable of giving help, or convinced their representative can handle it alone, or actively seeking to punish the community for some rebellion or failure of service.\nE\nA viceroy sending back false reports, Local grandee seizing control by violence, Cruel local lord who keeps the ruler pacified with tax money\nF\nInspector from the suzerain, Local judge seeking justice, Harried representative in need of help\nC\nThe ruler has too many problems to care about this place, The ruler would actually make things worse if they paid heed, The ruler’s authority is being hindered by some rival power\nT\nTax money not yet sent, A “gift” meant to draw the lord’s help, Proof of a plot to seize control of the community\nP\nDeserted courtroom, Street crawling with local vigilante groups, Burnt-out home of a political loser\nPilgrimage Site §\nThe community is centered around a major pilgrimage site. This may be a religious location of importance to a major faith, or it may be a more secular institution that draws the traffic, like a famous academy or the remains of some wondrous ancient work. Considerable local tension likely exists over controlling the access to the site and maximizing the profits from foreign visitors.\nE\nOutsider boss seeking to seize control of the site, Corrupt hereditary site controller, Rival saboteur bent on despoiling the site\nF\nWell-meaning pilgrim, Scholar with dangerous historical theories, Earnest caretaker of the site\nC\nThe site can only handle so many visitors without degrading, The pilgrimage site is dangerous, The keepers don’t fully understand the site\nT\nPrecious relic of the site, Beautifully-made fake of some critical relic, Secret true history of the site\nP\nExpensive pilgrim lodgings, Street full of hawkers of pilgrimage tokens, Alien and wondrous pilgrimage site\nNew Industry §\nThe natives have established a new industry here, and it’s making them a great deal of profit. Old patterns of authority and wealth are being disrupted, and the old gentry are unlikely to be pleased about it. They may be trying to take over the industry, or they may have been the ones to enable it in the first place and are using it to crush the life out of any rival power bases. Outsiders might be playing a major role as well, and it could be they plot to siphon off the profits.\nE\nArrogant and ruthless new oligarch, Scheming old-money grandee, Grasping and heartless industrial magnate\nF\nHopeful new entrepreneur, Local elder trying to deal with the change, Innocently naive outside investor\nC\nThe gentry would prefer poverty to losing power, The gentry are split on the industry, The industry comes with severe and unequally-distributed downsides\nT\nProfit from the industry, A valuable device to improve the industry, Tools of sabotage\nP\nRetrofitted old workshop, Resource-extraction site, Crowded worker housing\nPlagued City §\nThe community is cursed with recurrent spells of some troublesome disease. The affliction isn’t so fatal as to make living there impossible, but it adds suffering and expense to local lives. The plague might be the product of an ancient curse, the results of long-lost toxic remains, or an unavoidable byproduct of whatever industry or purpose justifies the city. It’s probably not overly contagious, but visitors may be in some peril all the same.\nE\nCharlatan selling false hope, Merciless grandee gladly worsening the plague for profit, Dark sorcerer seeking to weaponize the sickness\nF\nTraditional healer wise in the plague’s ways, Appealing waif struck down by the illness, Impassioned healer seeking a real cure\nC\nThe plague has a positive side-effect, Only certain classes suffer the plague, Passage into or out of the community is strictly controlled\nT\nA real cure for the plague, Hidden wealth of a plague victim, The key to halting the cycle\nP\nWorn-down sickhouse full of locals, Cemetery overflowing with the dead, Business based on providing for a sufferer’s special needs\nPopulation Boom §\nA vast influx of newcomers has recently rushed into the community. They may have been drawn by economic opportunities, or fled some pursuing peril, or been forcibly moved there by a ruler who wanted to dilute the existing native cohesion. The natives may not have the resources or opportunities to integrate these newcomers, and it may be that the new population has no desire to stay longer than is necessary.\nE\nViciously xenophobic grandee, Newcomer leader who despises the locals and their ways, Grasping merchant exploiting one or both groups\nF\nLocal trying to bridge differences, Newcomer trying to make a new life, Local official trying to keep the peace\nC\nThe newcomers act like conquerors, Their cultures are extremely imiscible, The natives are now highly dependent on newcomer industry\nT\nPrecious relic brought by the newcomers, Loot confiscated or extracted from the newcomers, Riches earned from newcomer labor\nP\nJarringly different newcomer quarter, Market with informally segregated areas, Tavern welcoming to only one group\nRebel Stronghold §\nThe community is in tacit or open revolt against their supposed overlord. If it’s distant from their suzerain’s power centers or exceptionally well-fortified, they might be an open nest of rebels and provide overt support to their ruler’s enemies. More vulnerable communities will provide shelter, secret support, and a base of supply for hidden bands of insurgents. Loyalist locals must keep their sympathies hidden or suffer the consequences.\nE\nPsychopathic but charismatic rebel leader, Savage rebel-suppressing general, Traitor leading the rebels to their doom\nF\nIdealistic young rebel, Frightened local just trying to survive, Sympathetic outside mediator\nC\nOne side of the dispute is correct but profoundly unsympathetic, A rebel victory would ultimately be catastrophic, The lord can’t afford the disruption that violent suppression would create\nT\nCache of valuable rebel supplies, Tax money stolen by the rebels, Secret rebel identities and plans\nP\nRebel base hidden outside the community, Tavern full of sympathizers, Burnt house of a loyalist\nRaider Scourge §\nAlmost every community has some problem with bandits and highwaymen, but this community is seriously plagued with raiders. One or more groups of persistent plunderers are hitting the community repeatedly, and they lack the necessary resources to fend them off or protect all their holdings.\nE\nWould-be ruler turned bandit chief, Rival agent backing the bandits, Traitorous native wielding the bandits against their enemies\nF\nRunaway ex-bandit, Embittered victim of their plundering, Merchant desperate for help\nC\nThe bandits are cooperating with a local power bloc, The bandits are a direct consequence of some local political decision, Mustering military force would have dire political consequences\nT\nPlunder stolen by the bandits, A shipment of some vital good that was waylaid, Evidence of corroborators or informers\nP\nScene of gory slaughter on the road, Burnt farmstead outside the community, Makeshift and dirty bandit camp\nRigid Castes §\nThe locals are divided into several castes. They may be organized by social role, by imputed nobility of birth, by ethnic origins, or any other dividing principle, but they cannot imagine any other way of organizing themselves. A hierarchy of castes is not inevitable, but there will be social and legal limits applied to ensure that each caste remains fixed in its function. The outside world may or may not respect these distinctions when dealing with the locals.\nE\nConqueror seeking to impose “civilized” castes on outsiders, Impostor who’ll commit any crime to conceal their true caste, Abusive upper-caste grandee\nF\nUnfairly mistreated caste member, Determined reformer with a “better” caste plan, Outsider trying to undo the caste system\nC\nThe castes are marked by ancient physiological alterations, Even the low caste locals are convinced the tradition is right, Exceptional money or talent can change a person’s caste\nT\nProof of a group’s real caste, Goods created by a caste’s unpaid labors, Sacred regalia only a certain caste can touch\nP\nCaste-divided residential quarters, Temple dedicated to a caste, Workshop of a caste\nScars of War §\nThe community is still bloodied by a recent violent conflict. A crushing bandit raid, a lost siege, getting caught at the periphery of a major battle, or some other calamity has inflicted severe damage on the place. Some communities may suffer a longer-term version of this, their youths lost in a grinding, endless battle against some perpetual threat.\nE\nSavage tyrant left over from the fight, Outsider taking advantage of their weakness, Native driven to extremes by their losses\nF\nBedraggled survivor, Outsider who’s come to help, Relative of someone lost in the battle\nC\nThe damage was mostly taken by one group, The losses have thrown the old social order into chaos, The locals are desperate to make the losses “worth it”\nT\nPlunder taken during the fight, Wealth left behind by the dead, A cache of treasure concealed by looters\nP\nDamaged half-occupied house, Burnt-down civil structure, Fields pocked with torched cottages\nSecret Treachery §\nThe community is in secret rebellion against their ostensible liege, having cut deals with his enemies, plotted to betray him for their own gain, or bridled under his tyranny and sought a better lord. The community’s leadership is all in on this plot, and outside viceroys or representatives are being kept carefully ignorant of the reality. The common folk may be oblivious to the truth, though they’ll doubtless have felt the same motivations and promptings that convinced their leaders to turn traitor.\nE\nSuspicious investigator from the tyrant, Scheming local chief who plans to be the new lord, Monstrous thing that they made a pact with\nF\nLocal being cruelly mistreated by the tyrant, Honest representative trying to resolve the tension, Local grandee trying to stay out of it all\nC\nOne of the leaders is a double agent waiting to roll all the traitors up, The leaders disagree on methods, There’s more than one group of traitors who don’t know about the others\nT\nProof of the conspiracy, Bribes intended for the leadership, Relic smuggled in by an outside supporter\nP\nSmoky back room, Sullen public gathering, Secret chamber in a leader’s home\nSeat of Rule §\nSome important ruler or leading figure resides in the community. This may be the seat of a regional lord, or it could be the traditional residence of a high priest, great magus, merchant house, or other wielder of influence. The community itself may or may not be under their direct control, but the wishes of the august figure must be acknowledged by the locals.\nE\nCorrupted and venal ruling figure, Conspiring usurper of the role, Vicious rebel against the ruler\nF\nWorried advisor to the ruler, Petitioner seeking help, Rebel against an unjust ruler\nC\nThe ruler is a figurehead controlled by someone else, The community is struggling to keep the seat, The ruler is not legally recognized but everyone knows the reality of their influence\nT\nRiches brought to petition the ruler, Ancestral ruling regalia, Treasure hidden by a ruler of old\nP\nGrand and ancient audience hall, Elaborate edifice now no longer used, Public building related to the ruler’s role\nSinking City §\nThe community was built atop something unstable, and now that substrate is crumbling. It may be swampy ground or a decaying coastline, or it could be an ancient buried city that’s now giving way. In the case of some antique habitation, the denizens that once lived there might be boiling upward as their home is collapsing, or new opportunities may be revealed even as the community’s present structure is ruined.\nE\nUnspeakable evil from below, Ruthless local causing damage for the sake of profit, Outside exploiter preying on the displaced\nF\nStruggling local defender, Native made homeless by the collapse, Curious explorer bent on discovering what lies beneath\nC\nThe collapse was caused by someone, Only the slums or the noble quarter collapsed, The collapse hasn’t happened yet but it’s going to\nT\nRecently-uncovered treasure, Vault buried when the building became a sinkhole, Key to halt the collapse\nP\nPit where a manor once was, Fallen city wall, Freshly-exposed underworks\nTheocratic Authorities §\nReligious leaders are influential in almost any community, but here they make up the final authorities. It may be an explicit theocracy, with rule by the clerics of a particular faith, or a temple might be so important and powerful that the official leaders are helpless to resist its will. The locals can be expected to be loyal adherents to the faith, or else the less pious majority is deeply intimidated by the religion’s believers.\nE\nRebel backed by a rival religion, Heretical priest trying to usurp authority, Eldritch being masquerading as a heavenly envoy\nF\nWell-meaning but zealous priest, Insurgent against a wicked theocracy, Harried town leader trying to please the clerics\nC\nThe theocrats are divided into struggling factions, The theocracy is the result of the former regime’s complete failure, The priests don’t want to lead but nobody else is acceptable to the people\nT\nReligious relic conferring the right to rule, Precious sacred scripture, Tithe gathered for the temple\nP\nOrnate and splendid temple, Shrine room within an ordinary house, Magistrate-priest’s courtroom\nTrade Hub §\nThe site is a major trade hub, connecting several important cities or resource production areas. It’s probably at an important river juncture, ancient crossroads, or occupying the only safe path through some perilous wilderness. Its position may be important enough that it can survive on trade alone, despite being unable to feed itself with the surrounding land. Such hubs are usually heavily garrisoned by the lord who profits from their tariffs and taxes.\nE\nCheating merchant prince, Corrupt judge or trade official, Grasping ruler with heavy taxes\nF\nConfused foreigner with strange ways, Dealer in some vital adventuring good, Exotic stranger in need of help\nC\nThe locals trade with Outsiders or other entities normally shunned by humans, The merchants effectively rule the city, There are pockets of exotic cultures found nowhere else in the kingdom\nT\nPrecious goods not produced in this land, Map to some fabulous foreign treasure, Gift intended for a local ruler\nP\nBazaar full of alien speech, Caravansary built in a foreign fashion, Palace of conspicuous opulence\nToxic Economy §\nThe community is reliant on an industry or product that has toxic or negative side-effects as part of its production. The good is extremely valuable, or the community is extremely desperate, and the side-effects are endured as a necessary evil. It may be that their neighbors or lord are forcing them to produce the good so that they aren’t the ones suffering the cost.\nE\nCruel sorcerer-merchant, Indifferent magnate wringing more production out of people, Trader in flesh who profits by the sick and feeble\nF\nHealer trying to cure the side-effect, Crippled local maimed by the product, Outside trader trying to soften the consequences of the trade\nC\nThe side-effect only harms an expendable class of people, The afflicted are isolated from the healthy, The side-effect are social or economic rather than physical\nT\nA temporary protection from the toxin, A load of the precious good, A device that worsens the toxin but creates more of the good\nP\nPesthouse full of the crippled, Splendid mansion built off the product’s profits, Factory full of lethal fumes and effects\nUnique Product §\nThe community produces something unique, a good or service that cannot be had anywhere else in the kingdom. This may be due to some unique resource found only there, or some carefully-guarded craft, or it may be a special service that can only be provided by the locals, who are somehow unique in their forms or abilities.\nE\nMagnate forcing more production at a grim cost, Ruler demanding more tribute, Rival saboteur planning to turn the product dangerous\nF\nNaive but superbly talented artisan, Innovator seeking to improve the product, Outside trader trying to protect their deal\nC\nThe product involves a vile component that outsiders can’t accept handling, The product is extremely useful to very unpleasant entities, Multiple rulers claim rights over the community\nT\nA cache of the product, The secret method of its production, Valuable components used to make the product\nP\nFactory full of busy creators, Resource extraction field where a vital component is gathered, Market crowded with traders from far places\nUpstart Faith §\nThere’s a relatively new religion in the community which is rapidly gaining power. It might be a sectarian offshoot of a major faith, the unique product of a new prophet, or an outside faith backed by wealthy and powerful foreign supporters. Depending on the demands made on believers, the new faith may be a matter of concern only to the existing clergy, or it might be a major flashpoint for conflict in the community.\nE\nFalse prophet gathering thralls, Hostile native cleric with dark plans, Outside manipulator profiting by the strife\nF\nSincere new priest, Local trying to keep out of the crossfire, Existing cleric trying to make peace\nC\nThe faith has very different teachings for inner and outer members, The secular leadership backs the new faith to weaken the existing temples, The faith has both sympathetic and unpleasant traits\nT\nSacred relic of the new faith, Temple relic stolen by new convert to the faith, Tithe offered up by wealthy new convert\nP\nHastily-made new temple, Now-empty existing shrine, Market with informal religious segregation\nWidespread Prosperity §\nThe community is uncommonly rich, not only for the gentry but for the common citizens as well. They may produce a valuable good, oversee precious resource extraction, have special economic favors from the ruler, or simply have inherited a vast body of infrastructure. Their neighbors likely view them with envy, and outside raiders and exploiters find them an ideal target.\nE\nCunning raider chieftain, Greedy overlord, Arrogant local ruler over-proud of their wealth\nF\nLocal being exploited for their wealth, Agent of the local prosperity’s maintenance, Outside trader trying to make an honest profit\nC\nThe prosperity is coming at another community’s cost, Their rivals claim their prosperity is wholly undeserved, The impending end of the prosperity is visible to all\nT\nCasually-stored riches, Device that creates some critical infrastructure, Cache of weapons meant to defend the wealth\nP\nCommoner neighborhood as opulent as that of the gentry of elsewhere, Market full of luxuries, Edifice of unusually advanced infrastructure\nWarring Council §\nThere’s more than one leader in the community, but at least some of them are at each other’s throats. It might be a conflict between formal leadership and informal authorities, or it could be a struggle among civil officials. Their interests might diverge sharply, or it could be a personal grudge that’s boiled over. Outside threats and internal problems are likely being ignored until the power struggle is resolved.\nE\nShadowy kingmaker bent on breaking resistance, Megalomaniacal new leader, “Owned” leader forced to fight for his backers\nF\nNeutral leader seeking a resolution, Outside investigator looking to understand the situation, Local suffering from some trouble that’s being ignored\nC\nThe most capable leader is also most at fault, The struggle is being incited by an outside rival, They’re arguing over a problem that seems insoluble\nT\nBlackmail on a leader, Treasure being fought over, Item that would resolve the struggle\nP\nNow-abandoned council room, Site of a steadily-increasing problem, Tavern stronghold of one of the combatants\nXenophobic Locals §\nThe locals despise outsiders. For some “outsiders” may be natives of foreign lands, while others might have a grudge against anyone from outside the community. Almost every community in the Latter Earth has some degree of wariness toward strangers, but these locals have an active loathing, and the few outsiders allowed to trade or interact with them do so at a heavy disadvantage.\nE\nUtterly unfair local magistrate, Local magnate who abuses outside laborers, Leader who always paints outsiders in the worst possible light\nF\nSecretly curious local, Cruelly mistreated outsider living there, Grudging diplomat seeking a modus vivendi\nC\nThey have a very good reason for hating strangers, Their outsider neighbors hate them just as much, They’re the last remnant of their kind and fear being absorbed\nT\nPrized symbol of their people, Wealth confiscated from an outsider, Forbidden outsider objects kept sealed away\nP\nCultural edifice devoted to the local past, Tightly-guarded city walls, Architecture that only makes sense to the locals"},"Toolbox/WWN/Worlds-Without-Number-Tags---Court-Tags":{"title":"Worlds Without Number Tags - Court Tags","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Affliction’s Mark §\nSome sort of persistent, incurable illness is gnawing at the court. The principle leader might have been felled by it, or a beloved member, or it may be a spreading curse within its circles. Acute diseases will likely have the sufferers desperate to find some cure, while chronic illnesses might need regular infusions of some costly or morally-dubious remedy.\nE\nManipulative quack, Amorally desperate parent, Secret spreader of plague\nF\nAppealing victim, Struggling physician, Worried spouse-to-be of a victim\nC\nThe sickness is a direct result of their choices, A faction would profit enormously if the current victims died, The only known cure comes with a dire moral or material cost\nT\nPalliative that can slow or ease the disease, Proof of its source or cause, The price gathered to pay for a perhaps-real cure\nP\nHushed and shadowed sickroom, Gathering place with an air of forced gaiety, Untouched quarters of the recently dead\nAwesome Legitimacy §\nThe things that are certain in life are death, taxes, and this court. They are important, they have always been important, and they always will be important. They may wax and wane, but no one in their society can imagine them ever ceasing to exist, and at most the locals can only think of seizing control of the court or compelling its cooperation. Its destruction is unthinkable. It may have absolute control of some critical social function, have members of legendary awe, or be viewed as the personal property of some divinity or godlike entity.\nE\nImplacable tyrant consecrated by custom, Manipulator who cloaks his will in the court’s legitimacy, Outsider who’ll ruin the court despite the chaos such a thing would create\nF\nCourt member keenly aware of their responsibility, Local haplessly oppressed by the court, Outsider who deals cautiously with the court\nC\nThe court really is as indispensable as it seems, The source of its untouchability is weakening, If it goes down it’s taking much of local society with it\nT\nRegalia of ancient authority, Dusty deed to a rich property, Wealth of a failed rebel against it\nP\nLong-forgotten spare throne room, Ancient archive, Gathering place in use for ages\nAncestral Obligation §\nThe court was impressed with some great task, duty, or role by its founder, and much of its influence or moral authority hinges on continuing to carry out that task. Its traditions and structure revolve around being able to carry out the work. Failure means disgrace and perhaps tangible penalties as old pacts are broken. Aside from this, neglecting the duty may result in other negative consequences, perhaps to parties other than the court itself.\nE\nSchemer who’d profit by the duty’s disruption, Rebel who hates the duty and care nothing for the consequences, Tyrannical leader who forces others to bear the duty’s cost\nF\nGrimly-determined keeper, Sympathetic member who suffers from the work, Outsider desperately reliant on the work being done well\nC\nNo one fully understands the duty’s meaning any more, The duty comes at a terrible cost, Recent calamity has left them too weak for the work\nT\nVital tool for carrying out the job, Ancient payment for the work, Key to lifting the burden\nP\nAncient work-chamber, Hall emblazoned with symbols of the work, Training hall for carrying on the work\nAwkward Birth §\nA pregnancy is roiling the court and causing severe problems. It may be that a member is pregnant by the wrong man, or a pairing took place that was shocking to society, or a newly-born heir is showing signs of inherited Blight, or a new heir suddenly excludes a displeased prior incumbent. The court can’t hush it forever, and abortion is either impractical, unacceptable, or too dangerous to the mother. This may not stop certain members from trying.\nE\nElder who would see the problem “solved”, Murderously suspicious husband, Demoted heir\nF\nNaive young lover, Desperate hidden paramour, Worried sire of the unwanted child\nC\nSecret accusations of illegitimacy are being passed through the court, The disgraced husband’s family is enraged, The pregnancy is just a tool the mother is using to get her way\nT\nProof of the real father, Blackmail material on the court’s leadership, Wealth stolen away by the former presumptive heir\nP\nNursery much worse-appointed than expected, Prison-like room for the expectant mother, Stronghold estate of the disappointed former heir\nBlandished Leadership §\nThe leadership has been led astray by one or more pretty girls or boys. They dote on their paramours, granting them extravagant favors and imperiling the court with the lengths they go to in order to please their beloved. Those not given to romantic dizziness may be enraptured by more physical talents, so occupied in the business of night that nothing is done in the day.\nE\nRival who sent them the playthings as gifts, Ruthlessly manipulative lover, Murderously angry neglected spouse\nF\nSadly displaced former favorite, Frustrated underling, Disapproving moralist\nC\nThe paramours have a supernatural edge in their charms, Their spouse likes them distracted so as to carry out their own plans, The court is fighting over influence with the paramours rather than the leadership\nT\nPriceless luxury demanded by a lover, Trinket of great worth abandoned by them, Wealth gathered to build some pleasure for them\nP\nSeraglio of constant liveliness, Court hall abandoned by the leadership, Pleasure-garden redolent of luxury\nCapricious Orders §\nThe court is issuing unreasonable orders to those under its authority, demanding excessive tribute, unreasonable obediences, or similar sacrifices. The court leader may be new and over-confident of their power, or the court may be in dire trouble and needs more resources, or rival forces may be goading or manipulating the court into overplaying its hand out of recklessness or ignorance of the true state of affairs.\nE\nArrogant new lord, Mentally unstable or bewitched ruler, Scheming advisor in a rival power’s pay\nF\nMistreated subject of the court, Frustrated moderate member, Reasonable rival of the current ruler\nC\nThe demands are all to fulfill a great secret plan, The demands are punishment for a failed rebellion, The court doesn’t want to make the demands but is somehow forced to do so\nT\nHeavy load of tribute, Stolen treasure that the court demanded be produced, Privately-diverted wealth from the demands\nP\nAngry court reception hall, Public plaza with darkly-grumbling locals, Enterprise closed down due to a failure to deliver on the demands\nCadet Branches §\nThe authority of the court is somewhat splintered, with multiple cadet branches of the family, enterprise, or department having their own share of its power. These branches are likely to struggle over control of the main court, with some of them perhaps preferring the court’s dissolution rather than allowing a hated rival to gain control of it.\nE\nDisgraced scion with a plan for revenge, Ruler who hates a particular branch, Scheming leader of a minor branch\nF\nBastard offspring seeking recognition, Visionary from a cadet branch, Rightful leader denied their place\nC\nOne “cadet” branch actually has a right to rule but is too weak to claim it, The main court plays the branches against each other, Outside rivals want the court to remain splintered\nT\nProof of a branch’s illegitimacy, Bribe paid to get a branch to cooperate, Blackmail material on the main court’s ruler\nP\nOstentatious branch estate, More modest but far older main estate, Court hall with places for all the branches\nCultural Insignia §\nThe court produces some famously revered cultural product, such as literature, poetry, painting, sculpture, music, dance, or other art form. Their members may have a direct tradition of production, or they may be the critical patrons of a tradition of artists or a school that produces the product. The product wins them respect among the cultured, and many would be glad to assist them in exchange for the luster of association.\nE\nRuler who would crush rival schools, Chief artist gone mad with jealousy or megalomania, Rival artist determined to destroy the tradition\nF\nEarnest young artistic genius, Poor court member determined to patronize as best they can, Unworldly aesthete concerned only with art\nC\nThe art has actual magical powers when well-made, The art encourages or glorifies some reprehensible cause, The artists are savagely factional in their different schools\nT\nLost legendary work of art, Proof that a famed piece of art is a forgery of the original, Hidden masterwork of a dead genius\nP\nSalon dedicated to appreciating the art, Workshop where the art is made, Grand public structure adorned with the art\nDaring Ambition §\nThe court has a grand ambition which is driving its actions, and it’s making a major bet on its ability to achieve its goal. Failure will mean catastrophe for the court, while success promises great rewards. Not all the members of the court are necessarily sharing the same risks and potential payoff, however, and some may be paying more than they’d ever profit.\nE\nMegalomaniacal leader, Well-meaning but hopelessly optimistic ruler, Secret manipulator driving the ambition\nF\nSympathetic necessary sacrifice for the cause, Court member struggling to do their share, Ally who’d profit if the court succeeded\nC\nThe court thinks the ambition is one thing but the leadership knows it’s another, The ambition’s success would be a poisoned gift, A faction plans to monopolize the benefit or shift all the loss\nT\nCritical material for the ambition, Costly remnants of a failed effort, A valuable result of progress in the ambition\nP\nEnterprise or establishment dedicated to the cause, Newly-constructed edifice, Hall optimistically prepared to celebrate victory\nDecadent Court §\nThe court is too absorbed in their pleasures and indulgences. Their cooperation is purchased with coin or flesh, their disports grow ever more costly and excessive, and even the minor members are getting accustomed to shameful enjoyments. Their power is being turned toward facilitating their membership’s appetites rather than fulfilling whatever role got them their status in the first place.\nE\nJaded and sensation-starved ruler, Cruel panderer for the court’s hungers, Monstrous entity that sponsors or encourages vice\nF\nEscaped would-be subject, Inquisitive outside investigator, Frustrated native in need of the court’s execution of its duty\nC\nThe court’s leadership is uninvolved and using the vices to blackmail and control their underlings, The court’s trying to spread its vices in its own social stratum and profit accordingly, A faction is taking things much too far even for their brethren and involving occult powers\nT\nDebt-slave contracts, Hideous but precious idol or art object, Valuable drug made from slaves\nP\nDebauched salon, Court public hall made sinister, Pit where the human chattel are kept\nDark Secret §\nThe court has a dark secret that would cost it dearly if it were to be revealed. Loss of influence, station, money, or power might all be consequent. It may involve old treacheries, hidden crimes, secret illegitimacies, dark pacts, or harsh choices that were unavoidable at the time. The uppermost ranks likely know the truth, but the lesser members may have nothing but unpleasant suspicions.\nE\nThe villain they’re allied with, Ruthless keeper of secrets, Amorally villainous ruler\nF\nSecretly worried lesser court member, Outside investigator, Bitter survivor of the court’s crime\nC\nThe act was acceptable or normal at the time it was committed, Revealing it would implicate other important powers, The court’s leadership has tried to quietly make amends for it\nT\nProof of the heinous crime, Precious treasure acquired through the sin, Valuable relic taken from a victim of the crime\nP\nSecret archive full of dark evidence, Noble monument built on a dark substrate, Private sanctum for only the inner circle\nDevil’s Bargain §\nThe court made a bargain that’s now coming back to haunt them. Some pact with an outside power gave them a crucial edge or a desperately-needed boost, but now it needs to provide services, favors, or help that could end up destroying it or costing its leadership dearly. The pact was probably secret at the time, and even revealing it exists could have dire repercussions.\nE\nVile entity it pacted with, Ruler planning on foisting the price off on a victim, Heartless creditor who cares nothing for the damage it does\nF\nUndeserving victim of the price, Rival who suspects something is up, Enemy of the power they pacted with\nC\nOnly a small faction of the court knows about the bargain, The current leadership didn’t know about the deal until it was threatened into compliance, The power they pacted with is a mortal enemy of their society\nT\nBlackmail material the pact granter is using to control them, Potent relic granted in the deal, Heavy tribute due to the pacting power\nP\nMonument to the victory the pact secretly gave them, Secret chambers for the pact’s granter, Shrine to the dark entity they propitiated\nDiplomatic Demands §\nSome rival or outside power is making demands on the court that they cannot easily ignore. It might involve some prior offense in need of reparations, a past deal that’s come due, or a price required for a favor that the court desperately needs. These demands are more than the court can easily pay, and determining where the burden will fall most heavily is a matter of fierce internal politics.\nE\nScheming shifter of burdens, Outside rival bent on beggaring the court, Incompetent diplomat who’s only making things worse\nF\nVictim of unfair exactions, Harried diplomat with no cards to play, Native who desperately needs the deal to go through\nC\nThe exactions demanded are purely punitive, There’s a specific temporary reason the court has to acknowledge the demands, Another party could give a better deal if they were persuaded\nT\nHuge down payment on the demands, The precious object the court is trying to acquire, Proof that the demands are unjustified\nP\nDiplomatic retreat full of tense people, Site of the problem causing the demands, Hushed court hall full of whispers\nExcess Heirs §\nWhile the ruler remains vigorous, they have too many legitimate heirs for the court to comfortably absorb. There’s not enough wealth or power to give the losers a dignified station, or else the losing heirs may expect to be executed, or the heirs are locked in a court-disrupting battle to force their desired outcome. Various heirs might be backed by rival outside powers searching for a convenient catspaw.\nE\nCruel but talented crown prince, Scion in league with dark powers, Secretly murderous spare heir\nF\nCapable but hard-pressed candidate, Hapless ruler unable to enforce a choice, Vengeful retainer of a murdered heir\nC\nThe ruler desires a Darwinian culling of heirs, The court desperately needs the heirs to cooperate to overcome a threat, Several heirs were formerly unknown\nT\nProof of a candidate’s illegitimacy, Bribe from an enemy power, Relic meant to eliminate a rival\nP\nWell-fortified home of an heir, Court hall where the factions are well-separated, Ritual occasion of enforced amity\nDisputed Inheritance §\nThe court’s rule or property is due to pass on to the next generation, but there are multiple claimants to it. Each has some colorable legitimacy, and factions and secret supporters are doubtless rife in the court. They’re well-balanced enough that brute force seems a risky route to take, though matters are rapidly coming to a head as the need to establish a new leader is intense.\nE\nCruel and vicious heir, Incompetent heir who has the best claim, Outside enemy backing the strife\nF\nMost talented heir but with the worst position, Hapless heir in dire need of protection, Loyal retainer trying to avert disaster\nC\nLegitimacy rests on possession of a now-lost relic, If the struggle lasts much longer the patrimony will be ruined or lost, A selfish regent is exploiting the court during the interregnum\nT\nBribe intended for the faction leaders, Precious relic of legitimacy, The real and verified will\nP\nTense and angry court meeting hall, Heir’s country estate, Court plaza where the factions don’t mingle\nFalse Prize §\nThe court is trying to obtain a goal or ambition that will actually be disastrous for it. Either through political miscalculation, ignorance of the truth, or willful blindness to the consequences, they’re plunging headlong towards calamity. Rivals might be secretly aiding them in their purpose, while factions within the court may be uselessly protesting the danger of the path they’ve chosen.\nE\nFoolhardy ruler with grand plans, Treacherous advisor encouraging disaster, Trickster leading the court to its ruin\nF\nClear-sighted court member who is being ignored, Victim of the danger the court is facing, Disfavored faction leader warning of peril\nC\nThe prize’s benefits will attract an overwhelming foe, The prize will corrupt or ruin the court’s leadership, The prize comes with secret problems or obligations that will plague the court\nT\nProof that the prize would be a disaster, The key to unlocking the prize, Rich reward that seems to be a foretaste of the prize’s benefits\nP\nEdifice built as part of the effort, Ruined seat of a former holder of the prize, Secret facility where terrible prices are paid in pursuit of it\nFatal Extravagance §\nThe court is exhausting itself on luxuries or displays of magnificence that it cannot truly afford. It may feel pressured to do so in order to maintain face before its rivals, or it may over-estimate its resources, or it may be being manipulated by whatever group they’re buying their luxuries from. Optimistic courts may be betting on a future windfall that may or may not come.\nE\nSmiling merchant of addictive drugs, Grandiose ruler, Selfishly hedonistic court member\nF\nCourt member vainly trying to economize, Worried accountant, Client upset at the lack of expenditures on their vital need\nC\nThe extravagance is serving a secret magical or ritual purpose, It’s being paid for with debt the court intends to never need to repay, The waste is the product of a new ruler who has different expectations of what they deserve\nT\nShipment of precious luxuries, Payment meant for the next round of indulgences, Precious item that is to be pawned or sold to fund the luxuries\nP\nGaudily-adorned court structure, Celebration of wild excess, Ostentatious and newly-built monument to their luxuries\nForeign Ties §\nThe court has strong ties with some foreign power or organization, one that may or may not be hostile to their greater polity. The court draws some considerable advantage from this tie, but it’s also expected to assist its affiliate in their own local goals. If the affiliate is an enemy or rival of their people, this tie may be carefully hidden, or it may be a known scandal about the court.\nE\nForeign spymaster with demands, Rival who despises the foreign power, Court member who’s a wholly-owned agent of the power\nF\nAppealing foreign petitioner, Harried court member trying to square their obligations, Outside inquisitor into suspicious doings\nC\nThe power used to be friendly to the polity but has recently been viewed as a rival, The court is secretly reliant on the foreign power’s support, The support consists of the foreign power not doing something that they could do\nT\nFunding from the power, Precious item the court needs to turn over, The macguffin the power wants the court to obtain for them\nP\nCourt hall in an architectural style like that of the power, Home with foreign-derived elements, Archive with documents in a foreign tongue\nForbidden Romance §\nSomeone in the court is deeply in love with someone they shouldn’t be. It may be a rival from another court, a lowly commoner, an incestuous bond, an attraction to a forbidden demihuman, a fellow court member’s spouse, or a spectacularly horrible person who can only bring them misery. This love may or may not be reciprocated, and it may be an open secret to others.\nE\nUnreciprocated lover who won’t take no for an answer, Cruelly manipulative object of affection, Court elder bent on terminating the relationship\nF\nEarnest matchmaker friend, Appealing paramour, Aspiring peacemaker who wants the match\nC\nThe reasons for opposing the match are extremely good, The court member is being exploited by the paramour or their manipulators, A rival court member wants the match to go through so the court member will be disgraced\nT\nProof that the lover is not what they seem, A gift the enamored should not have given, A token that will legitimize the pairing\nP\nSecret rendezvous spot, Hidden prison for a reluctant lover, Court festival where unacceptable hints are given\nGate Keeper §\nThe court controls access to some critical resource or social function. It might have an effective lock on the local law, or control the irrigation network for regional farms, or provide vital religious services to faithful believers. If it abuses this power too greatly, however, its rivals will combine against it and may seize control of the resource.\nE\nReckless leader who’s overplaying their hand, Outside schemer planning to break their monopoly, Corrupt court member who’s undermining the control for their own benefit\nF\nEarnest outsider with a monopoly-breaking idea, Frustrated court member trying to reform the monpoly’s administration, Hard-pressed local mistreated by the monopoly\nC\nThe next alternative monopolist is much worse, A monopoly-breaker has vile intentions, The monopoly rests with them for secret but very good reasons\nT\nSome good produced by the monopoly, License or leave to violate the monopoly, Device that greatly weakens the monopoly\nP\nSite where the monopoly is practiced, Secret wildcatter site of unlicensed production, Private production site of one of the court’s elites\nHidden Blight §\nOne or more members of the court are afflicted with the Blight, but are concealing their condition. Their particular Blight is not physically obvious to onlookers, but may have severe psychological or hidden physical manifestations. At least some of the other court members have a good reason to aid this concealment, if only to avoid the scandal of being known to carry Blighted genetics.\nE\nBlight-demented leader being shielded by others, Ruthless investigator seeking answers, Murderous court member bent on “resolving” matters\nF\nBlighted struggling with their curse, Court member trying to protect the secret, Blighted parent trying to help their child\nC\nThe Blight is light enough to be lifted somehow, The Blight is somehow useful to the afflicted, They disguise the Blight as a wildly excessive human inclination\nT\nDrug that ameliorates the Blight, Proof of a Blighted lineage, Bribe paid to hush the matter\nP\nSecret retreat for expressing Blighted urges, Hall of glorified ancestral memorials, Prison for badly-affected Blighted members\nImpure Blood §\nBloodline and lineage are important to the court, either because of a bloodline-dependent power or a society that places much importance on it. Despite this, the court’s lineage would be considered impure by others were it fully known, perhaps due to some secret pairings in the remote past. The court might have to go to extremes in order to mimic the powers appropriate to their supposed bloodline, or else go to similar extents to crush any hint of the truth.\nE\nCourt assassin cleaning up loose ends, Rival prying into a dangerous leak, Court member making a terrible bargain to blot out the stain\nF\nCourt member undeserving of the obloquy, Innocent threatened with disaster by the truth, Hunter seeking the entity they pacted with\nC\nThe “impurity” was once celebrated in the hidden past, It’s an open secret but their rivals lack actionable proof, They’re privately working to overthrow the rules that would call them impure\nT\nProof of their impurity, Device that gives them power they wouldn’t normally have, Inheritance from their hidden ancestry\nP\nHidden site associated with their concealed blood, Proud monument to their social station, Secret graves of their real ancestors\nHopeless Rival §\nThe court has a rival or enemy that bears a burning desire to destroy them. Unfortunately for them, they’re wholly incapable of doing so. This fanatical desire may be born of past crimes, cheated opportunities, or an ancient feud. In their desperation to strike at their enemy, it’s likely the rival will go to extreme and unwise lengths, perhaps making bargains they ought not to make.\nE\nOft-beaten rival of the court’s ruler, Disgraced court member turned renegade, Spare heir with a grudge\nF\nSympathetic enemy of the court, Rival’s associate trying to stop them from going too far, Inquisitor looking into nefarious dealings\nC\nThe rival’s hate is very justifiable, The rival’s engineering a clash with a greater power, The rival is being set up as a kamikaze attack by a manipulative third party\nT\nDoomsday tool the rival means to use, Blackmail material on the court, Precious relic the rival paid dearly to acquire\nP\nSite of the rival’s past defeat, Location related to the hate, Structure built with the fruits of the court’s past victory\nInadequate Tools §\nThe court’s authority and power have been sustained for a long time by a particular set of tools and tactics, such as violence, money, blackmail, legal rights, or perhaps by particular alliances with other powers. Recent events or clumsy missteps by the court have rendered these old tools no longer effective, but the leadership doesn’t have any better idea than to use them again, but harder this time.\nE\nManipulator goading the ruler to excesses, Frustrated ruler with no new ideas, Court member scheming to restore their old power\nF\nAnguished victim of their overreach, Court member trying to find new footing, Member fearful of the consequences of their frustration\nC\nThe tools are “working” but are building up a ruinous debt of resentment, Their efforts are only serving to strengthen their rivals, The tools are actually going to be completely successful if the ruler’s scheme to push them to an extreme works\nT\nRelic to empower their favorite tactic, Wealth needed to fuel their plans, Priceless implement necessary to effectively use their tactics\nP\nStructure dedicated to their favorite methods, Site where the method went awry, Site of the method currently in use\nInept Ruler §\nThe court’s ruler is incompetent or debilitated, but there’s no practical way to remove them from power. The alternative might be utterly unacceptable, or the ruler’s bungling might be very much to the benefit of a powerful faction in the court. Rivals are doubtless making plans to take advantage of the situation, and internal factions may well be willing to take acceptable losses in order to profit by the chaos.\nE\nInsane ruler, Sincere but utterly unsuitable leader, Sinister manipulator influencing the puppet ruler\nF\nCompetent but unsupported alternative ruler, Victim of the ruler’s bungling, Faction leader being crushed by the ruler’s ineptitude\nC\nThe ruler seems like an idiot but is actually trying to achieve a secret goal with their actions, Rival courts are vigorously backing the leader, The leader’s deposition would result in a ruinous state of chaos for the court\nT\nToken that would legitimize a change of rule, Object that would cure the ruler’s incapacity, Wealth that was lost by the leader’s bungling\nP\nDamaged or decrepit structure owing to the ruler’s neglect, Chaotic and confused court hall, Building erected as a folly by the ruler\nLost Purpose §\nThe court’s original formation revolved around a particular duty or role that has long since been forgotten. This may be a metaphorical forgetting, like a idealistic young businessman turning to cold-hearted avarice, or it may be a literal loss of some ancient charge or consecrated role. This forgetting may have left the court with ancestral obligations they no longer understand, or resources they no longer use in the intended way.\nE\nLeader wholly absorbed in their own ambitions, Outsider made hostile by the court’s failure to do their duty, Enemy who prospers by their forgetting\nF\nEarnest historian who knows the truth, Last stubborn upholder of the role, Petitioner who needs them to do their old duty\nC\nThe purpose was a vile and terrible one, Their current prosperity depends on ignoring the purpose, The consequences of their forgetting are going to be dire\nT\nProof of their original purpose, Potent artifact meant to aid their role, Treasure once given to them in repayment for their work\nP\nForgotten chamber for the duty, Lost site of importance, Place damaged by the forgetting\nIron Law §\nThere are troublesome or problematic laws to the court that its members simply cannot break. They may be enforced by magical curses, by an inborn predilection of the court’s members, or by a tradition that would unite all rivals against the offender. These laws are likely preventing them from resolving a problem that is currently growing worse.\nE\nSuicidally rigid ruler, Troublemaker who exploits the law, Traitor who is somehow immune to the law’s force\nF\nInnovator trying to work around the law or repeal it, Troubled defender of the law who sees the problem, Affiliate who can’t be helped because of the law\nC\nThe law is there for a good reason and breaking it would be worse than the problem, The law can be changed if a certain great deed is done, The law’s enforcer is corrupt or mutable in judgment\nT\nKey object that gives the law its force, Token that allows the bearer to ignore or lift the law, Precious treasure that is unreachable as long as the law remains in force\nP\nChamber of judgment, Punishment place for offenders, Site of the growing problem\nMagical Subversion §\nSome member of the court is under magical influence by another, be it an outside enemy or internal rival. It may be mind-bending sorcery, a persistent magical curse, or an arcane blessing that will last only so long as they cooperate. The culprit has some means of ensuring this subversion is not easily detected, either through occult arts or simply ensuring that others never get curious enough to look for such things.\nE\nHarmless-seeming member who’s a secret mage, Mercenary sorcerer hired by rivals, Court favorite who induces that affection with magic\nF\nSuspicious local mage, Relative with suspicions but no proof, Victim of uncharacteristic behavior by the subverted member\nC\nThe subversion is part of a known and accepted enchantment on the target, They’ll die or suffer horribly if the subversion is lifted, They’re consciously cooperating with the subverter\nT\nCharm to lift the curse or mindbending, Proof of magical interference, The artifact being used to subvert the target\nP\nOut-of-place location to find the target, Site that’s recently been changed to fit their new demands, Sinister lair where the enchantment was wrought\nMinisterial Capture §\nThe upper functionaries or senior household servants of the court have taken effective control of it. The members may be too distracted to realize what’s been done, or the servants may have irresistible blackmail on them, or they may have the unjustified but complete trust of the proper leadership. These functionaries are using the court’s resources to pursue their own aggrandizement and profit.\nE\nColorless senior bureaucrat, Scheming butler, Spymaster or intelligence chief turned kingmaker\nF\nMinor court member who realizes the problem, Lesser functionary upset by the corruption, Proper leader made helpless by the situation\nC\nThe ministers think the proper leadership is incompetent, The ministers are really serving a rival, The leadership honestly prefers to leave everything to the ministers\nT\nDocumentation proving ministerial malfeasance, Malversated court resources, Blackmail evidence on the court leadership\nP\nAbandoned official audience chamber, Private residence of the ministerial kingmaker, Clerkly offices bustling with petitioners\nNew Opportunity §\nSome special new opportunity has been presented to the court, one that offers a great deal of personal wealth or glory. Only some of the court can take advantage of it, however, and it can be easily spoiled by dissent from within; they argue now over who is to be allowed to exploit the opportunity. New unexplored lands, royal monopoly patents, the hand of a very eligible spouse, or some other limited windfall awaits the winner.\nE\nBitter enemy who had the opportunity taken from them and given to the court, Jealous internal spoiler who plots to ruin it, Leader who greedily seeks to keep all of it to themselves\nF\nTalented but ill-supported candidate, Outsider who wants the opportunity handled fairly, Disenfranchised true discoverer of the opportunity\nC\nIt’s a trap and will ruin those who embrace it, The ease of any one spoiler ruining it has paralyzed deliberations, The opportunity has its own ideas about who should exploit it\nT\nKey to unlocking the opportunity, Rich treasure safeguarded by the opportunity, Token that will allow the holder to exploit the opportunity\nP\nSite where the new chance is brightest, Camp or building for preparations, Site of a failed effort\nNew Generation §\nThe court’s prior leadership was recently decimated by age, sickness, misadventure, or political executions, leaving many leadership posts in the hands of much younger, less experienced members. Few of them have a firm grasp on practicalities, and they’re acting with a confidence and boldness that may not necessarily be justified by their actual skills.\nE\nReckless spare heir turned ruler, Upstart using a role purely for their personal advantage, Outside rival pouncing on their untested leadership\nF\nHarried senior advisor who is ignored, Baffled new ruler who doesn’t understand how it works, Idealistic new office-holder with big dreams\nC\nThe new generation is being held back by ossified existing members, They have magnificent plans that will fail spectacularly, They didn’t want the jobs but were forced into them by circumstances\nT\nLost treasure or resources the old guard hid, Ceremonial regalia that imbues legitimacy, Secret plans or archives that the former ruler hid\nP\nNewly-remodeled court residence, Audience hall adorned with freshly-changed arms, Ministerial office full of confused and harried clerks\nOutside Debts §\nThe court owes something awful to a pitiless outside power, whether a rival court, an enemy of their homeland, a vile sorcerer, a merciless banker, or a grasping lord. The consequences of failing to repay the debt would be catastrophic, but the court can’t afford to do so without some members of them being ruined by the price, whether in coin, criminal conviction, disgrace, or eternal damnation.\nE\nRuler who means to shift the debt to another, Savage enforcer of the debt, Culprit who brought the debt on them with their ambitions\nF\nInnocent being forced to pay the price, Suspicious investigator looking into the debt, Past victim of the creditor’s cruel ways\nC\nRevealing the debt’s existence would ruin the court, The creditor completely deserves to be paid, An old rival has bought the debt and now holds it\nT\nRiches needed to pay off the debt, Proof that the contract was invalid, The document or token that is needed to enforce the debt\nP\nLair of the creditor, Court holding being sold or given away to help satisfy the debt, Great court ceremony made insultingly meager to save money\nOverextended Grasp §\nThe court has seized control of land, offices, noble roles, businesses, or some other valuable holding, but they do not hold it securely. Rival forces are pressing on them and they have exhausted their resources in simply gaining the prize, and have nothing left with which to keep it in the face of resistance. The rivals may simply be fighting to determine which of them is to overthrow the overextended court’s grip.\nE\nFoolishly ambitious ruler, Schemer who has profited by the reach even if it fails, Desperate leader who is abusing the prize to help keep it\nF\nFormer holder of the prize trying to regain it, Earnest new owner in far over their head, Loyal retainer struggling with insufficient resources\nC\nThe prize is a poisoned fruit that will destroy them if they don’t let it go, They gambled on support that has been somehow delayed or denied, They mean to destroy the prize rather than lose it\nT\nRiches meant for the owner of the prize, Device or document that will destroy the prize’s value, Treasure the rivals mean to use to seize the prize\nP\nSeat of the prize’s authority, Court holding that’s understaffed and under-resourced, Marginal prize holding that’s already been lost\nPoisonous Cliques §\nThe court is riven by at least two viciously hostile cliques, both of which are determined to ruin or kill the other. Nonaligned members of the court are forced to submit to one or the other lest they be enemies to both and all normal business of the court is paralyzed by their incessant quarreling. This hostility may be open and overt, or it may be veiled behind venomous courtesies and cruelly heartless protocols.\nE\nOutside rival who provoked the clique formation, Traitor seeking mutual destruction, Brutal clique leader who will do anything for victory\nF\nUnaligned member trying to stay alive, Outside ally distressed by the infighting, Weak leader unable to rein in the hostilities\nC\nOne clique is sympathetic but just as determined to attain total victory as the other, The cliques are destroying the very prize they fight over, A secret internal faction waits to pick up the pieces\nT\nTreasure the cliques are fighting over, Tool or artifact meant to break the stalemate, Documents showing a traitor within one clique’s leadership\nP\nWell-separated court residences for the cliques, Holding ruined by their infighting, Destroyed former residence of a loser of the fighting\nPriestly Influence §\nThe court’s leadership is in the thrall of a particular religion or holy figure, and their wishes are given an undue weight. This influence may be a matter of perfectly sincere faith, or the religion might have some special grip on the court due to blackmail, services rendered, or special need. Such influence often brings the hostility of rival faiths until a more equitable arrangement is made.\nE\nRasputin-esque holy figure, Zealously pious ruler, Spider-minded court chaplain with strings on everyone\nF\nCourt member who favors a different god, Cast-off former house priest, Client abandoned so that resources could go to the faith\nC\nThe faith is giving major help to the court, The sect the court follows is considered heretical by the main faith, The faith’s opponents in the court are being backed by a hostile outside group\nT\nSacred relic of the faith, Costly tithe sum to be offered to the faith, Symbol of authority over the court’s religious practice\nP\nGrand newly-built chapel, Abandoned chapel of a former faith, Ritual site for a new ceremony\nRampant Corruption §\nThe court is so corrupt that it’s crippling its ability to function. Even the most mundane exercises of authority require that the right people be bribed or induced, and its members have little or no interest in the overall good of the group. The leadership is hanging together only because the court is profitable and they will defend it only insofar as it remains so.\nE\nHopelessly venal ruler, Greedy kingmaker behind the scenes, Colorless head bureaucrat with sticky palms\nF\nMember with an earnest loyalty to principle, Court member cast out for not playing along, Victim of some bribed crime the court committed\nC\nThe court’s members actually desperately need the money, All the graft is going to only a few strong hands, Their enemies have multiple traitors on their payrolls\nT\nGreat hoard of extracted pelf, Inescapable proof of a leader’s wrongdoing, Misdirected bribe payment\nP\nGrimy back room where deals are made, Court salon made a market for favors, Court structure clearly starved of its supposed funds\nProxy Speaker §\nThe court’s leader communicates only through a particular proxy, be it a chief minister, spouse, heir, concubine, confessor, or other figure of importance. The leader may be too sick or enfeebled to lead or the proxy may have systematically cut all their other lines of control. The other members of the court may vie for influence over the proxy, perhaps while ignoring their ostensible real ruler.\nE\nGrasping favorite odalisque, Impatient heir-proxy, Scheming regent-minister\nF\nWorried child of the leader, Cast-off former advisor, Persecuted enemy of the proxy\nC\nThe proxy is actually the cause of the leader’s incapacitation, The proxy is a much better leader than the real one, The proxy is really working for a rival or enemy power\nT\nCure for the leader’s incapacitation, Proof of the proxy’s unsuitability, Wealth subverted by the proxy\nP\nAbandoned throne room, Sick chamber of incapacitated leader, Proxy’s office teeming with petitioners\nRecent Brutality §\nViolence is an unfortunate commonplace in many courts, but something happened here recently that was beyond all usual bounds of polite assassination or genteel political execution. Some vast massacre of a whole family line, a berserk slaughter of an unlucky gathering, a humiliating and unthinkable execution of some grandee, or some other dramatic brutality has put everyone on edge and made many start thinking of some previously unthinkable courses of action.\nE\nRuler with out-of-control bloodthirst, Spree-killing spymaster, Brutal court member with no one daring to check them\nF\nHeir to a recent victim, Helpless enforcer of the usual norms, Survivor of a recent massacre\nC\nThe victims arguably deserved it, The source of the violence is being secretly controlled by a member, Everyone else is about to embrace the new norms of violence if it’s not punished soon\nT\nDevice used to enable the killing, Treasure left behind by one of the slain, List of who is to die next\nP\nHaunted site of the killing, Secret memorial to the slain, Unbearably tense court ceremony\nRegency Council §\nA council of powerful regents runs the court due to the youth, incapacity, or sickness of the legitimate ruler. Some of these regents may actually have the ruler’s interests in mind, but others are exploiting the court’s resources for their own benefit, taking it as no more than their just due for their services. Some may be making a point of ensuring that the regency is a permanent state of affairs.\nE\nAbusive prime minister, Selfish parent- or relative-regent, Self-absorbed great noble guardian\nF\nLoyal servant of the true ruler, Well-meaning member of the council, Deposed former regent who was too loyal\nC\nThe regents are keeping a totally disastrous ruler from taking power, The strength of the regents is direly needed right now, One or more regents is in a rival power’s pay\nT\nProof of the council’s treachery, Remedy for the ruler’s incapacitation, Resources necessary to make a loyalist strong enough to take control\nP\nCouncil chamber crowded with servants, Private villa for secret dealings, Ceremonial throne room where the ruler is ignored\nRival Dreams §\nThe court has big dreams; unfortunately, they’re contradictory. Two or more major factions each have a grand plan for the court’s future success, but these plans are incompatible, and the factions are struggling to determine which of them the court will follow. The leader is either incapable of breaking the deadlock or else they support one of the plans but lack sufficient allies to impose it on the unbelievers.\nE\nCharismatic but wildly impractical dreamer-lord, Selfish purveyor of a plan that will chiefly aid them, Stubborn ruler who will brook no compromise with their dream\nF\nGenius with poor social skills, Inheritor of a familial dream, Would-be peacemaker between the factions\nC\nBoth dreams are likely to damage the court, They agree on the goal but have contradictory ways of getting there, The dreams are irrelevant and only an excuse to eliminate a rival faction\nT\nVital resources to achieve a plan, Critical device needed for a plan, Proof that a plan is hopeless\nP\nSalon or base where a faction schemes, Field where a partially-complete plan is being furthered, Half-completed monument to glory\nRestive Lessers §\nThe court’s servants and lesser officials are angry with the leadership. Old privileges may have been revoked, traditional rights and fees may have been curtailed, or particular sacrifices or dire perils may have been demanded of them. The court is confident that their lessers can do nothing but obey, but the minions are very close to a dramatic response.\nE\nRuler who cares nothing for their displeasure, Arrogant chief minister, Outside rival backing disunity in the court\nF\nAggrieved lesser official, Worried grandee who sees trouble coming, Client who needs the court’s unimpaired assistance\nC\nTraditional but corrupt perquisites were reformed and the minions were deprived of them, A much loved official or leader was killed or deposed, Other courts’ minions are getting perks or benefits that this court can’t afford to give\nT\nSubverted wealth traditionally due to the minions, Document proving old rights, Treasure taken from a leader of the minions\nP\nQuietly furious servant’s quarters, Ominously deserted hall, Far-too-crowded plaza where the minions gather\nRival Power §\nThe official hierarchy of the court is being challenged by a second power source within the organization, one strong enough to stymie its official lord. This may be a faction formed by a powerful lord, a charismatic religious faction, an intrusive consul of a superior power, or an impatient heir with too many friends. Neither power source can act freely while the other exists, but destroying the rival may bring down the court in the process.\nE\nUnofficial pretender to the rulership, Secretive kingmaker, Incompetent leader with strong help\nF\nCourt member trying to make peace, Victim of the rival factions’ infighting, Disillusioned former backer of a faction\nC\nThe rival power has a very good but also very self-interested reason to seek control, The rival power has all the most competent people, The legitimate lord will bring down the court with him if he’s overthrown\nT\nTokens of legitimate authority, Blackmail sufficient to ruin a faction, Resources suborned by a faction\nP\nUnofficial throne room of the rival faction, Court offices split into different groups, Unnaturally well-fortified country estate of a faction\nRuling Regalia §\nThe court’s rulership rests on one or more ancient, powerful relics. Quite aside from any practical use they may have, they symbolize the leader’s right of rule, and any loss of them will throw the court into chaos. It’s not unknown for the court’s leadership to be suddenly changed when a new rival manages to seize them, whether by guile or brute force.\nE\nMaster thief in the employ of a rival, Strong-arm court member plotting their chance, Outside figure who just wants the relics’ power\nF\nTraditional guardian of the relics, Ruler too weak to reliably safeguard them, Would-be thief trying to get them from an unworthy ruler\nC\nThe relics were lost some time ago and are currently forgeries, The power of the relics is objectively necessary for the ruler to function, A bearer will die if the relics are removed for too long\nT\nDevice that will destroy or nullify a relic, Perfect forgery of a relic, Another relic perfectly identical in all ways\nP\nTightly-guarded repository for the relics, Ceremonial procession showing the relics, Court structure or edifice powered by the relics\nShining Successor §\nThe impending heir to the court is a remarkable figure, gifted with tremendous aptitudes or personal capability. Everyone is convinced they will lead the court to new heights of glory, though existing powers may prefer that glory be postponed indefinitely rather than give up their current posts.\nE\nBitter mother of a rival heir, Ruler who refuses to admit their capability, Vengeful former heir who was put aside\nF\nWorried mentor of the successor, Ruler who fears for their successor’s safety, Loyal minion of the successor\nC\nThe successor is a genius but has truly horrible traits as well, The successor is being backed by a rival who thinks to use them, The successor’s talents are vast but are precisely the wrong skills for the situation they will face\nT\nRegalia due to the rightful heir, A marvelous work produced by the successor, Proof that the successor has no legitimate claim on rulership\nP\nSalon where the successor shines brilliantly, Site of a grand triumph by the successor, Throne room where the successor gets more attention than the ruler\nRunaway Rule §\nOut of overwork, sloth, or carelessness, the court has devolved much of its authority on some subsidiary group or power, leaving it to do the dirty work of a critical function. That group has seized control of that authority, however, and now bids fair to claim leadership of the court itself using its newfound leverage.\nE\nAmbitious leader of the lesser group, Indolent and careless ruler, Greedy minister profiting by the devolution\nF\nClient suffering due to the subsidiary’s actions, Minister robbed of effective power by the group, People being oppressed by the group’s excesses\nC\nThe group has considerable outside backing, The group really is doing something critical to the court’s function, The court is now actually incapable of handling the group’s duties\nT\nWealth obtained by the group’s actions, Treasure given to the group originally to induce them, Powerful relic obtained by the group as a tool\nP\nStructure dedicated to the group’s devolved duty, Country estate of the group’s leader, Abandoned structure of the court that once handled it\nSplendid Seat §\nThis court operates from a seat of power far beyond the splendor of their peers. It may be some ancient Working full of magical powers and benefits, or an ancestral fortress famed in song and legend, or a complex built around some source of precious material or extracted good. Much of the authority of the court might derive from their control of this seat.\nE\nRuler who is relying too heavily on the seat’s benefits, Saboteur seeking to destroy the seat, Hostile entity bound or associated to the seat\nF\nCaretaker of the seat’s benefits, Court member fascinated with the seat’s history and nature, Servant of a line with ancestral ties to the place\nC\nThe seat exacts a cost from those who dwell there, The seat’s real power is misunderstood by all save the ruler’s inner circle, The seat is somehow a prison as well as a throne\nT\nKey to unlocking the seat’s secret powers, Precious relic of a former age, Wealth obtained through the seat’s qualities\nP\nStrange chamber of some long-lost purpose, Hidden room deep within the structure, Grand and magnificent structure embodying the site\nSublime Skill §\nThe court is tremendously good at a particular role or function that their society finds important. Magnificent soldiers, legendary artists, famed diplomats, pious official-priests, or some other quality of note defines them. This skill may be the product of a venerable tradition of instruction, however harsh it may be, or it could be the result of a magical bloodline or inhuman admixture.\nE\nRuler who takes the trait much too far in a bad direction, Renegade who uses the skill against the court, Outside power trying to manipulate the skill for their own benefits\nF\nUnworldly but extremely talented court member, Outsider curious about the nature of the skill, Friendly rival seeking to test their skill\nC\nThe skill comes at some compensating cost, The court is fairly useless for anything but that skill, The court is abusing its skill for its own benefit\nT\nRelic or item that can confer the skill, Wealth obtained through the skill’s exercise, Magnificent trophy of some prior legendary feat of skill\nP\nMonument to prior exercise of the skill, Training hall where the skill is honed, Memorial hall full of tokens of past glory\nThreatened Violence §\nThe shadow of impending death hangs over the court. The ruler may be ordering capricious executions, assassins may be active, a particularly bloody custom may be in full effect, or the court’s superiors may be hunting for traitors. The court members are on edge and willing to do desperate things in order to avoid death or direct the killing toward their enemies.\nE\nParanoid ruler seeing knives in every shadow, Master assassin with a grudge, Renegade who’s returned to take vengeance\nF\nSurvivor of a murdered member, Worried bodyguard looking for help, Frightened member convinced they’re next\nC\nThe violence is being blamed on the wrong source, People are using the killings to settle private scores, The victims were all part of a secret scheme\nT\nPoison suitable for eliminating anyone, List of those next to die, Document with information that will stop the killings\nP\nGory scene of death, Unbearably tense court function, Trial full of panicked participants\nSudden Strength §\nA grand stroke of luck, a brilliant plan, or a feat of sublime diplomacy have resulted in a great influx of wealth, influence, or support from outside the court. The group now has access to a newfound strength that may be fleeting, and not all members may have equal access to the benefits. The existing structure of authority is unlikely to be well-equipped to exert this new influence in delicate or well-considered ways.\nE\nPower-drunk ruler pushing things to excess, Desperate rival trying to sabotage the court before it’s too late, Outside patron using this new strength as a lever to control the court\nF\nOfficial struggling to cope with the new situation, Old court friend now seeking help, Victim of a poorly-considered exercise of the strength\nC\nThe new strength is causing damage each time it’s deployed, Their backers are just letting the court overextend itself before pulling the aid, The court’s agents are taking personal advantage\nT\nMoney obtained by the good fortune, Potent relic that’s part of the new strength, Secret evidence of the real purpose of the help being given\nP\nCrushed rival’s estate, Gaudily-upgraded court holding, Confused site of sudden activity\nWaning Wealth §\nThe court is heading towards poverty, and its members know it. The source of their wealth is under attack, either by a rival, a greedy superior, an outside enemy, or sheer misfortune. If things continue as they are the court will be unable to maintain its place, and its members are contemplating desperate measures to shore up existing holdings or acquire new ones.\nE\nRuler who’s making unreasonable demands for member sacrifices, Sinister creditor who demands repayment, Monstrous foe who’s ruining their holdings\nF\nHarried chancellor looking for money, Client left destitute by lack of support, Former manager of a now-ruined holding\nC\nThey’re cutting secret deals with enemies of their land, Unpopular members are being beggared to support the others, Their clients are being squeezed dry just to keep the court solvent\nT\nLong-lost treasure the court is hunting, Deed to some profitable holding, Device that will revitalize or repair a ruined property\nP\nThreadbare throne room, Meager noble dining hall, Abandoned once-profitable holding"},"Toolbox/WWN/Worlds-Without-Number-Tags---Ruin-Tags":{"title":"Worlds Without Number Tags - Ruin Tags","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Ancient Archives §\nThe site once housed archives or information that would be very interesting to certain modern powers. The utility or value of this information should be obvious to the players, even if they’re initially unaware of its existence. Known archival sites might have sealed their lore behind some fearsome guardian or a “puzzle” consisting of access procedures that were self-evident in the age it was constructed in.\nE\nMaddened archive keeper, Powerful figure who wants the information kept hidden, Secret-seeker who brooks no rivals\nF\nHelpful ancient archive attendant, Hired investigator, Seeker of some related lore\nC\nThe information is conveyed in idioms or forms that are no longer clear, The information is very dangerous to know, The information is buried in seas of irrelevant data that need navigating\nT\nIndex to the desired information, Key to decoding the data, Cultural work that elucidates the idioms or medium being used\nP\nLibrary full of not-book data storage items, Scriptorium or other scribal zone, Chamber related to the topic or field of the data involved\nAutomaton Servants §\nThe ruin is still staffed by automaton servants or other immortal minions. Aside from obviously robotic servitors, magical golems, bound spirits, undead thralls, uplifted beasts, or other subject species might be found here. Such minions are usually magically bound to their roles, which may be causing them significant problems if their roles can no longer be carried out. It’s possible that some of them have re-interpreted their roles into something they can do, whether or not it’s something they should do.\nE\nCruel immortal artificer, Automaton leader gone mad, Outsider seeking to suborn them to their sinister service\nF\nHelpful automaton minion, Fascinated outside investigator, Local native who fears the minions\nC\nScrapped automatons are worth a great deal, The automatons are needed to maintain the ruin’s basic physical stability, The automatons have merged with or been altered by some outside power\nT\nCommand key for the automatons, Cache of valuable spare parts, Item they desperately need in order to fulfill their function\nP\nAutomaton maintenance area, Bank of unmoving figures, Place of endless automaton toil\nAspiring Conqueror §\nSome power within the ruin has ambitions of conquest, and plans to use the site as a base for dominating the surrounding lands. Such a warlord might be wholly reliant on the ruin’s denizens, or they could be recruiting minions from outcasts or renegades and so be willing to parley with adventurers. Not all the lieutenants of such leaders are always supportive of the plan.\nE\nInhuman warlord, Fanatical cult leader, Embittered outlaw-noble\nF\nHapless local village headman, Minion who reconsidered their allegiance, Former leader who was pushed aside by the new one\nC\nSome of the locals honestly think the conqueror would be a better ruler, The conqueror actually has a legitimate claim on the land, The conqueror is being backed by enemies of the local ruler\nT\nCache of military supplies, Plunder taken from their first victims, Important hostage in their keeping\nP\nRuin barracks whipped into order, Training field in use, Nearby village they’ve crushed\nBirthing Cyst §\nA horrible thing is growing in the ruin and will eventually erupt into some catastrophic peril or awful creature. The ruin may have been originally designed to facilitate this thing’s creation, or it could have been infested or perverted by some outside power. Outsiders may not realize the nature of the peril, or even mistake its growth for some positive process. The growth could be the product of ancient science, a magical ritual, or a conflux of geomantic forces.\nE\nGod-beast to be born for a long-dead faith, Obsessed ancient keeper, Outsider determined to provoke the catastrophe for their own ends\nF\nWorried local observer, Last surviving keeper of the ruin, Survivor of an early eruption of it\nC\nThe thing’s growth provides some profitable byproduct, People are completely mistaken about what’s growing down there, People think it’s already hatched and was dispatched\nT\nItem needed to harm or kill the thing, Key to halt or abort the process, Precious offerings made to the unborn disaster by fearful observers\nP\nArcane lab where it’s growing, Fortified chambers to guard it, Shrine depicting its eventual glory\nBitter Remnants §\nThe ruin is not entirely abandoned, as a remnant of its former creators still occupies the place. These survivors are almost certainly hostile toward the outside world and the intruders who have sought to take the place or loot it for uncounted ages. They may or may not have a full understanding of their ancestors’ purpose in the ruin, but they likely use any secrets they do know to best effect against invaders.\nE\nXenophobic remnant chief, Outside ruler determined to exterminate them, Powerful ruin rival that seeks their destruction\nF\nOpen-minded remnant member, Eager scholar seeking their secrets, Escapee from the terrible cruelties of the remnants\nC\nThe remnant society is genuinely and completely horrible, The remnants no longer or never did think like humans do, Certain outcasts have trade ties with the remnants\nT\nPrecious ancient relic they preserved, Loot taken from dead invaders, Secret history of the ruin full of useful information\nP\nAncient but meticulously-kept chamber, Ancestral place of rites unique to them, Maintained monument to past glory\nCyclical Doom §\nThere’s a phenomenon to the ruin that makes it tremendously dangerous at certain intervals. Fluxes of ancient radiation, swarms of quick-breeding dangerous vermin, withering geomantic conjunctions, or cyclically-awakened preserved inhabitants might make the place exceedingly deadly for intruders there at that time. The natives may or may not know about the cycle, and if it’s a very long one, they might not have been around to see it happen.\nE\nOutsider determined to trigger the cycle, Native leader who wants to weaponize it, Outside researcher with no care for the consequences\nF\nNative aware of the impending disaster, Researcher trying to stop the cycle, Survivor of the last cycle\nC\nThe cycle leaves behind a valuable byproduct, The cycle only threatens certain occupants, Outsiders have totally misinterpreted the cycle’s meaning or events\nT\nKey to trigger or halt the cycle, Device to protect users from the cycle, Object for controlling and directing the cycle\nP\nPlace scarred by a past cycle’s effects, Control or observation center, Monument obscurely referencing the cycle\nCivil War §\nThere are at least two organized factions within the ruin that are at war with each other. They all have motives that make simply leaving the place an unappealing prospect, and some of them might be eager to enlist outside help in ousting their rivals. Given the low population of most ruins, the war is likely a restricted one of raids, ambushes, and murders of convenience, and the traps and snares they set might catch more than their foes.\nE\nFaction leader with dreams of conquest, Crazed warlord, Treacherous plotter who betrays their hired help\nF\nFaction leader with benevolent aims, Innocent local caught in the crossfire, Would-be peacemaker\nC\nThey both want the same thing but in different ways, Both sides will unite swiftly against invaders, Neither side wants anything that outsiders are going to like much\nT\nThe macguffin they’re fighting over, Weapon to destroy their rivals, Wealth to bribe other helpers\nP\nSite of a vicious ambush, Defaced monument or symbol of a rival faction, Dangerous no-man’s land zone within the ruin\nDecrepit Structure §\nThe ruin is falling apart, and is actively dangerous to its inhabitants. Navigating between areas may require careful progress, extensive rope and piton work, or avoidance of certain obvious-but-hazardous routes. Native inhabitants may have adapted to the hazards or they might be newcomers who are learning the hard way. Some areas in the ruin might provoke a general collapse if they are significantly damaged.\nE\nOutside plunderer with no care for the consequences, Outsider actively trying to destroy the place, Berserk native trying to repair things\nF\nRefugee forced to live there, Native dweller seeking help to fix things, Architectural researcher\nC\nValuable materials can be looted by those indifferent to the increasing instability, The collapse would reveal or unleash a terrible thing, Many places in it can only be visited once\nT\nResources that can repair the damage, Precious loot that will destabilize the place if taken, Treasure revealed by a structural collapse\nP\nCreaking bridge or gantry, Room with numerous holes in the floor, Tower leaning at a drunken angle\nDesperate Hunger §\nNatives of the ruin just can’t get enough to eat, and their situation or the surrounding area makes it impractical to move somewhere else. Beasts may be extremely aggressive due to hunger, and intelligent natives might fight more for food than gold or glory. Many of the more savage types may have fallen back on cannibalism or hunting other sapients for food.\nE\nObese cannibal chieftain, Native leader who’ll do anything to feed their people, Sorcerer who gives dark nourishment to their servitors\nF\nStarved urchin-native, Anxious group leader wanting to cut a deal, Innovator trying to open up a new food source\nC\nThe overpopulation is being resolved by murder, The food-gathering areas were recently blocked off by something, Foodstuffs become toxic or inedible rapidly in the ruin\nT\nCache of preserved food, Key to open new hunting areas, Great treasure that’s viewed as trifling compared to the worth of food\nP\nPit of cracked and gnawed bones, Cages of meals-to-be, Viciously desperate feeding area for a group\nDistant Gate §\nThe ruin is connected to some interesting distant location, either through a magical gate, a portal of ancient technology, forgotten tube-cars in underground tunnels, or a more mundane hidden passage into an otherwise inaccessible place. The natives may know about and exploit this quality, or the gate may be sealed until some particular procedure or object is used to activate it.\nE\nGuardian of the gate, Hostile entity from the other side, Intruder determined to unlock the gate\nF\nHapless intruder from the other side, Native gate-guide, Explorer seeking a route to the gate’s destination\nC\nThe gate was sealed for a very good reason, The gate is one-way, Activating the gate risks destroying the ruin\nT\nKey to activate the gate, Codes to control its destination, Treasure from the far side of it\nP\nMysterious transit-chamber with symbolism related to the destination, Room with objects or remains related to the destination, Dangerously energetic gate room\nDire Tombs §\nThe ruin is characterized by a great many tombs or burial sites and a matching profusion of undead. The revenants may be mindless husks animated by dark magic or ambient power, or they could be intentionally created to act as guards or to continue “living” according to some long-lost death-god’s teachings.\nE\nUndead lord jealous of their solitude, Ravening undead hulk-thing, Necromancer eager for the raw materials\nF\nDescendant of the dead trying to keep them safe, Fascinated historical researcher, Undead-hunter trying to contain them\nC\nThe undead are not all of the same motives, The locals revere and venerate them as ancestors, The undead are just symptoms of something worse entombed there\nT\nBurial goods left behind, Plunder taken from unfortunate adventurers, Once-commonplace good that’s now extremely valuable\nP\nHalls of silent coffin-niches or urns, Chapel to a god related to the burial process, Splendid tomb to a dead hero or ruler\nDungeon Heart §\nThe ruin’s physical integrity is bound with a particular creature or object within the site, and if it is destroyed or removed the place will collapse. If the destruction is immediate, this danger should be clearly conveyed to the players unless the GM wants to risk a rapid campaign end. This relationship may be derived from an ancient magical curse, a sympathetic unity of magical power, or ancient self-destruct security mechanisms.\nE\nOutsider determined to kill or steal the heart, A heart-creature that would be very convenient or satisfying to kill, Native holding the heart hostage to force obedience\nF\nGuardian of the heart, Native eager to warn outsiders of the truth, Explorer with dire suspicions\nC\nThe “destruction” is metaphorical or societal in nature, Only a specific part of the ruin will be destroyed, No one involved realizes that it will cause a somewhat slow-motion destruction\nT\nDevice that will undo the link, The precious object that is the heart, Relic to control the linked things\nP\nChamber where the heart’s connection is visible, Place that shifts in sympathy to the heart, Damaged room reflecting damage to the heart\nExperimental Lab §\nA sorcerer or ancient artificer once used this place for their experiments, most of which were the sort that would never be tolerated in civilization. They may have been sponsored by some amoral power, or been independent theurges seeking the special resources, environment, or natives of this place to assist in their studies.\nE\nStill-surviving researcher, Hideous creation of the arcanist, Outsider bent on seizing all its dark lore\nF\nSympathetic creation of the sorcerer, Witch-hunter bent on destroying the secrets, Local plagued by the lab’s emanations or castoffs\nC\nThe lab is still in use, The lab’s patrons don’t realize what’s really going on there, The lab’s creations have gone out of control\nT\nValuable research byproduct, Treasure once owned by a research victim, Potent magical lore related to the lab’s focus\nP\nTesting chamber for the lab’s research, Occult and sinister laboratory, Pens for holding research stock\nFallen Sanctuary §\nThe ruin was a place of security within recent memory, until some event or invasion turned it into its present state. Some of the surrounding locals might have been associated with the site during its heyday and remember interesting facts about it. Others may still nurse dreams of returning it to its former glory once its current inhabitants are slain or driven away.\nE\nDark warlord who overthrew the place, Traitor who arranged its downfall, Terrible creature unleashed in the site’s dying throes\nF\nIdealistic would-be reconstructor, Native trying to make peace with the locals, Aged keeper of the site’s old secrets\nC\nThe site is fallen to the locals but a sanctuary now to a completely different group, The site is still dangerous and hostile to the interlopers, The locals desperately need to retake the site soon for some pressing reason\nT\nTreasures hidden by the former owners, The dark tool used to cast the site down, Token of rightful rule seized by the invaders\nP\nHidden chamber unknown to invaders, Defaced and ruined room dedicated to the site’s original role, Chamber re-purposed for the invaders\nFailed Intrusion §\nThe ruin recently experienced a serious incursion of outsiders, whether adventurers, bandits, government forces, angry villagers, or other hostiles. These intruders were repulsed, perhaps with significant loss of native life, and the ruin was considerably disrupted by the fighting. Important native leaders might have been killed or wounded, treasures might have been looted, or slaves and hostages might’ve been taken.\nE\nDesperate intruder leader still in the ruin, Bloodthirsty native leader craving vengeance, Dead leader’s heir full of terrible ideas\nF\nSympathetic intruder or native survivor, Escaped slave, Vengeful relative of the dead\nC\nThe intruders are too desperate to have entirely given up, The two sides basically ruined each other, Outsiders have entered to take advantage of the chaos\nT\nUseful relic lost by the intruding forces, Stolen treasure of the natives, Tribal treasure now inaccessible due to the chief’s death\nP\nSite of a hideous battle, Larder where the dead intruders are being kept, Local beast lair full of dragged corpses\nFalse Front §\nThe site actually seems to be a completely different type of place than it really is. You might generate a second basic function for the site and bill it as its true purpose, or conceal it as a currently-functioning structure of some kind. Either it was built this way originally or more recent owners have concealed the truth about it for their own benefit. Others may not realize that the ruin they think they know is just a facade over something deeper.\nE\nSecret master of the hidden ruin, Cruel schemer who established the false front, Monstrous foe still buried below the facade\nF\nClueless entrepreneur who means to exploit the false site, Explorer with curious references to the truth, Victim of something from the truth below\nC\nThe false front is a lure to bait prey, The false front is to deflect interest, The false front is meant to be useful or profitable to the true lord of the place\nT\nKey to reveal the entrance to the real site, Incongruous treasure from below, Valuable goods used to maintain the facade\nP\nChamber that doesn’t fit with the false front, Secret passage to the depths, Place full of costumes and props\nFeral Magic §\nSome potent Working or other ancient magic has gone berserk or rotten in the ruin, tainting the occupants and making the place dangerous to inhabitants. Whatever the magic once did, it now does it too much, or in the wrong way, or at a grim cost to those within. The natives either cannot escape, or have no place better to go, or are somehow dependent on the twisted magic.\nE\nMagically mutated abomination, Native chieftain full of tainted power, Outside sorcerer making reckless use of the magic\nF\nResearcher trying to understand or fix things, Sympathetic magic-plagued native, Outside victim of the site’s magic\nC\nValuable loot awaits those willing to break the magic further, The magic can be fixed if something dangerous is done, The decay is spreading outside the ruin\nT\nItem to ward off the magic, Valuable sorcerous byproduct, Ancient instructions on how to fix things\nP\nThrumming power center of the magic, Lair of magic-twisted beasts, Native shrine to the power\nFreshly Looted §\nThe site has been recently plundered, either by adventurers, organized invaders, or a specific faction within the site itself. Many creatures are either dead or driven off, and the rewards for exploration are limited. But as the site is newly-emptied, numerous outside groups or warbands are likely in the process of moving in, cleaning out the remnants of surviving inhabitants and setting up their own bases there.\nE\nConquering Blighted warchief, Ruthless bandit-adventurer who likes the place, Vengeance-mad chief of a rabble of survivors\nF\nSympathetic native driven out of the site, Frustrated adventurer denied a chance to loot, Local official charged with investigating the place\nC\nThe looters missed the most important treasure, A native faction was working with the looters, A group of natives successfully hid from the looters\nT\nTreasure hidden by dead natives, Relic lost by a slain looter, Valuable thing too big and heavy to carry out readily\nP\nEmpty treasure vault, Ruler’s lair plundered and defaced, Hall choked with the recent dead\nFlooded Halls §\nThe ruin is largely flooded, perhaps with water and perhaps with some worse substance. Exploring it is difficult, and the heroes constantly risk being trapped by rising waters or flow-shifted obstacles. The natives are either creatures adapted to water or desperate enough to live where few others can pursue them.\nE\nFish-thing with dark hungers, Cult priest of a watery evil, Chief of a piscid humanoid species\nF\nLuckless local boater, Hermit who’s tried to live there, Courageous treasure-diver\nC\nThe flooding is cyclical, Water flow can be controlled somehow inside the site, The water is fetid with disease\nT\nPearls or other water-fashioned valuables, Extremely precious relic that would be ruined by being soaked, Device to grant water-breathing\nP\nSplendid chamber now crusted by slime or coral, Half-filled room with an air bubble, Space full of totally opaque silty water\nFriendly Foes §\nA group dwells here that would normally be very hostile to humans or outsiders, yet is perfectly willing to deal with adventurers. They may be an anomalous group of their kind, or have desperate need for outside help, or have religious reasons to be cooperative. Few outsiders are likely to take their friendliness at face value, but they should be given the chance to be visibly friendly by the GM so as to clue the players in to the likelihood of peaceful dealings.\nE\nBloodthirsty adventurer who doesn’t believe them, Group leader with treacherous plans, Monstrous foe that threatens the group and outsiders both\nF\nFriendly being from the group, Local human with secret ties to them, Earnest outside missionary\nC\nThey’re friendly because of a very large misunderstanding they have, They really are totally sincere in their good intent, They’ve got a problem that only long-term allies can solve\nT\nGroup-made product normally never available to humans, Treasure they gathered from foes, Relic they’re using as a bargaining tool\nP\nMeeting space also furnished for humans, Separate dwelling area for outsiders, Chamber for obscure group rituals or worship\nHidden Within §\nThe ruin is actually underneath a seemingly-ordinary structure or inhabited human settlement. Secret passages or long-forgotten portals lead down into it, and only a short space away from ordinary human life a ruin can seethe with sinister secrets. The ruin may have been built over accidentally, intentionally buried, or perhaps excavated by the current structure’s original builders.\nE\nThing that creeps up from below at night, Long-buried evil, Reckless adventurer stirring up things beneath\nF\nPassage-wise urchin, Architect with too much curiosity, Hapless local sewer worker\nC\nThe structure’s inhabitants have a secret deal with the ruin dwellers, The ruin dwellers masquerade as the structure’s inhabitants, Time-delayed catastrophe will happen after the ruin’s opened\nT\nKey to open the hidden passage below, Treasure hidden in the ruin in ages past, Ancient relic the ruin was made to contain\nP\nPassage hidden behind now-crumbling construction, Mundane room above a monstrous evil, Secret passages that have peepholes into the structure above\nHiveminded Natives §\nA multi-bodied intellect exists in the ruin, whether an ancient AI, hiveminded swarm, telepathic gestalt species, unified golem force, or some other manner of creature. Some such hiveminds are inclined to “recruit” intruders, willing or otherwise. Conflict with these creatures is apt to be very dangerous, as they’re capable of coordination at a level impossible to others, yet their single mind makes them more vulnerable to a single point of failure.\nE\nCrazed ancient eidolon, Magically warped insect queen, Fungus-infected colony organism\nF\nEscapee from the hivemind, Last survivor of a recruited group, Researcher keen to study it\nC\nThe hivemind’s doubts are embodied in conflicting factions, It can focus only on so many bodies at once, It requires a connection to issue new orders\nT\nDevice to break the hivemind’s control, Curative to free a recruit, Intricate treasure fabricated by unified hivemind effort\nP\nLiving quarters with no private elements, Swarming chamber full of perfectly-synchronized motion, Fetid organic queen-lair of the ruling intellect\nHospitable Natives §\nWhile not all denizens of the ruin are friendly, there’s at least one faction that’s known to be willing to host guests and negotiate for favors. This group may be made up of bandits, exiles, hermits, or other social outcasts who find even the most dubious human visitors preferable to their neighbors, or they might be “civilized” humanoids who find it profitable to parley as well as raid.\nE\nSinister chieftain with ulterior motives, Xenophobic rebel who hates outsiders, Outsider adventurer bent on exploiting their hospitality\nF\nWide-eyed native urchin, Outsider gone native, Outsider envoy trying to make a pact with them\nC\nThey’re hospitable because they desperately need allies, They recently were betrayed by a guest, Their hospitality comes at a high price\nT\nTrade goods gathered from the ruin, Map of the ruin interior, Key to unlock a route normally accessible only to ruin natives\nP\nAlien but friendly meeting-chamber, Makeshift guest lodgings, Ritual room for strange rites\nInfectious Miasma §\nA contagious disease has infected the natives and might plague any intruders as well. The sickness isn’t fatal, but it may induce physical or mental changes that make life in the outside world difficult; the ruin itself might be an environment optimized for the afflicted. Conversely, the ruin might be a leprosarium or place of exile for those who catch some virulent plague or socially-despised illness.\nE\nTyrant physician-chief who controls treatment, Ruler maddened by the illness, Plague priest determined to spread the disease\nF\nInnocent native suffering from the sickness, Outsider medical missionary, Hapless chieftain trying to hold things together\nC\nThe ruin has been sealed off by the outside world, The plague turns the natives into living tools or slave-entities, Cures only temporarily suppress the disease’s symptoms\nT\nResearch needed for a lasting cure, Treasures left by a dead sufferer, Vital resources needed for the sick to survive\nP\nGathering-place full of the walking ill, Shrine to a healing god, Pits where disease-warped victims are exiled\nHostile Environment §\nRuins are seldom comfortable, but this one is actively dangerous to those who enter it. Noxious fumes, radiation, magical miasmas, contagious diseases, poisonous liquids, or some other environmental hazard makes progress very risky. Natives are either immune to the peril or have means of negating it. The extreme defensibility of the site may be the reason they continue to lair there.\nE\nSorcerer researching how to weaponize the hazard, Monstrous entity that emits the peril, Vile creature born of the toxic conditions\nF\nExplorer equipped with survival tools, Friendly native guide, Entrepreneur trying to exploit it\nC\nThe hostile environment also produces a valuable resource, Surrounding locals consider it taboo because the hazard is somehow contagious, The hazard is very recent and the natives still don’t know exactly how to handle it\nT\nProtective gear against the hazard, Controls to shut off the hazard in some areas, Loot from hazard-slain intruders or natives\nP\nMundane location caked in the hazard, Lair of a hazard-mutated beast, Perilous path that snakes through the hazard\nInvincible Delusion §\nThe natives of this ruin are totally convinced of something that is simply not the case: their ancient empire never fell, their god has commanded them to live a certain troublesome way, they are the only true humans left in the world, or some other delusion that’s likely to cause problems. They’ve developed rationalizations to explain obvious contradictions to their error, many of which involve hostile responses to bearers of iniquitous falsehood. There may be something about the ruin that’s enforcing this delusion.\nE\nHypnotically charismatic leader, Crazed ancient lich-ruler, Leader who knows the truth but profits by the error\nF\nNative with suspicions, Outsider trying to convince them, Outsider whom they’ve mistakenly incorporated into their error\nC\nThe delusion makes an otherwise unendurable life bearable, The delusion is true in some critical ways, The delusion is somehow infectious\nT\nProof of the delusion’s falsehood, Precious goods piled up for a lost cause, Relic of a golden age\nP\nRuin chamber made a pathetic mimicry of some greater place, Ritual chamber to celebrate the “truth”, Archive containing troublesome records\nLethal Treasure §\nThe ruin has or produces a very valuable good, but that good is somehow extremely dangerous to acquire or possess. It may be toxic, or cursed, or the acquisition process may be predictably lethal. This danger may be the result of the creatures who create the good, the guardians that watch over it, or the surrounding locals who kill “smugglers” or “profaners” with zeal.\nE\nMonstrous beast that produces the good, Ancient construct guardian, Cruel tyrant who forces victims to make or acquire the good\nF\nDesperate young adventurer, Native good-maker trying to avoid disaster, Victim of the good’s hazards\nC\nExtended exposure to the good is harmful, The good is useful but somehow morally dubious in its production or nature, The good needs to be specially processed to make it safe\nT\nLarge cache of unrefined good, Object to nullify or cure the good’s danger, Loot lost in an unsuccessful attempt to buy the good\nP\nHellish processing or production area, Tightly-guarded vault of the good, Area made toxic by the good’s effects\nLingering Curse §\nThe ruin is cursed, and everything in it is somehow tainted or troubled by the malediction. There must be a strong reason for the natives to remain, or else the curse itself induces them to stay. The curse may be the result of some ancient crime, a Working gone wrong, a lost war against a magical foe, or a “blessing” in one age that is less appreciated in the modern day. The curse usually takes some time to trigger on intruders, but it may be induced by certain actions.\nE\nVile sorcerer feeding on the energies, Embittered chieftain hating all uncursed, Hapless victim made a monster by the curse\nF\nNative sorcerer trying to lift the curse, Outside researcher investigating it, Sympathetic native struggling with the curse’s effects\nC\nThe curse grants a significant advantage as well as a blight, Those cursed need something here to survive, The curse is a mark of native belonging and viewed as proof of loyalty\nT\nObject that can lift the curse, Precious offering to the gods for mercy, Treasure left by a victim of the curse\nP\nShrine to some protective god, Curse-warped place of twisted mundanity, Chokingly-blighted place where the curse was first invoked\nLimited Access §\nThe ruin can only be accessed at certain times or with certain special keys. Any natives are cut off from the outside world for long periods, and must either have no need for sustenance or sources within the ruin. The obstacle may be magical in nature, or the only access route to the ruin may be subject to natural cycles that make it impassable at most times.\nE\nRuin tyrant who views all outsiders as enemies, Ruthless adventurer trying to block rivals, Mad power locked away in the ruin\nF\nEager young scholar, Adventurer with the key to the site, Native yearning to escape\nC\nIt’s been so long since the last opening that everyone’s forgotten about it, The access now opens in a very inconvenient place, The access can be forced by some terrible sacrifice\nT\nKey to open the access, Controls that permanently open the site, Loot from the last expedition to enter the site\nP\nPassage that opens on a time lock, Vast magical seal, Coastal portal revealed only during a particular low tide period\nLiving Dungeon §\nThe ruin is alive, either in a literal or metaphorical sense. It may be animated by an ancient eidolon that looks through countless sensors, or infused with the spirit of some arcane mind, or made up of the tiny bodies of countless construction-organisms like some vast coral. Physical damage to the ruin usually brings some hostile response, however muted by age and disrepair, and the structure itself may be conscious enough to strike bargains with inhabitants.\nE\nDemented ruin spirit, Sorcerer trying to bend the site to their will, Native chieftain who worships the ruin’s genius as a god\nF\nFriendly ruin sub-organism, Native ruin-keeper, Explorer avid to learn of the place\nC\nIt’s a colony creature with different minds in charge, The ruin is trying to grow at all costs, The ruin went berserk after its ruination and is now acting irrationally\nT\nPoison that can kill the ruin, Precious good created by the ruin’s life processes, Indigestible treasures left by prior intruders\nP\nWetly organic passageway, Chamber with a giant maw for feeding, Room with tethered organic servitor-creatures\nLost Colony §\nThe ruin was once a colony site for a now-vanished empire or people. Some of these pioneers might still survive within, albeit doubtless in much-changed form, or else their belongings might include objects or relics that would be very valuable today. The modern heirs to this lost domain might still consider the ruin to be their lawful property, and all within it to be theirs.\nE\nDegenerate colony leader, Outside conqueror seeking to seize the site, The hideous thing that destroyed the colony\nF\nConfused surviving pioneer-heir, New colonist trying to revive the place, Historian looking for relics\nC\nThe colonists claimed to belong to the lost kingdom but were really of a much more sinister group, Local powers quarrel over site access, Something extremely precious was lost here\nT\nOnce-commonplace item that is now precious, Ancient wealth of the colonists, Valuable goods they made before they died\nP\nArea decorated in their ancient style, Long-abandoned massacre site, Temple to a forgotten god\nMonster Forge §\nThe ruin somehow creates a particular type of monster by its simple existence. It might be an ancient spawning-pit for Blighted, a cloning facility gone berserk, an ancient agricultural complex with feral livestock, an open portal to an Iterum of monsters, a source of very infectious monster-creating plagues, or something in that vein. These monsters probably infest the surrounding area, unless something about their nature requires them to stay close to the ruin.\nE\nAlpha monster of the horde, Sorcerous would-be tyrant over the creatures, Terrible anomaly-beast that’s even worse than usual\nF\nVictim of a monstrous rampage, Grim monster-hunter trying to hold back the tide, Local lord overcome by the wave\nC\nThe ruin has only recently started to belch forth the creatures, The monsters capture humans to make more of their kind, The monsters were once slaves or servants but have now broken free\nT\nImplement meant to destroy or control them, Plunder brought back by raiding creatures, Treasures lost by slain adventurers\nP\nFrenetic chamber of ever-blossoming life, Overcrowded living quarters, Re-purposed ancient chamber\nMagical Wonder §\nAn active Working in the site produces some wondrous effect; permanent summer, biological immortality, endless foodstuffs, visions of the future, or some other grand marvel. Unfortunately, it’s so decayed and ill-tuned that all of these wonders come with related serious negative effects and problems, ones that the natives must struggle to deal with.\nE\nAncient half-mad keeper of the Working, Sorcerous monster born of the decay, Outsider determined to exploit the Working at any cost\nF\nAdventurer who seeks the Working’s benefits, Researcher who wants its secrets, Sorcerer convinced they can fix the Working\nC\nThe objects and benefits it confers don’t exist outside the ruin, It will collapse disastrously if the ruin is seriously damaged, Nearby communities benefit from it and try to keep out intruders\nT\nDevice to control the Working’s benefits, Ruined Working parts that are valuable still, Research notes that would allow it to be repaired\nP\nChamber of dangerous magical fluxes, Sorcerous emission point where the blessing flows forth, Abandoned laboratory where it was made\nOutsider Domain §\nThis ruin was originally constructed to serve a race of Outsiders. It is possible that they were not even humanoid, and the atmosphere within the ruin may still be tainted with alien gases or hostile temperatures. The architecture and lighting was designed for alien bodies, and humans might find it difficult to navigate. Surviving inhabitants might be Outsider remnants or the alien flora and fauna that persisted long after their masters had died out.\nE\nStill-surviving alien leader, Monstrous alien “pet”, Cult priest revering the dead Outsiders\nF\nSurviving heir of human slave-servants, Outsider-hunter seeking prey, Researcher looking for lore\nC\nThe site once produced something very important to the region at a terrible cost in lives, The alien atmosphere becomes unsurvivable in cycles, Humans Blighted by the Outsiders still live here\nT\nAlien artifact of great value, Human treasure collected by dead Outsiders, Alien device that does something very useful to modern humans\nP\nInscrutably strange chamber, Living quarters re-dimensioned to fit non-humanoid bodies, “Garden” full of monstrous flora\nPrecious Resource §\nThe ruin generates a resource or serves a function that is valuable to those around it. This may be a direct and literal generation, such as a Deep that still automatically extracts and refines silver, or it may be metaphorical, such as a ruin full of undead who are privy to ancient secrets sought by wizards. Completely purging the ruin of perils would probably somehow ruin the process, or else some greedy outsider would likely have cleaned it out by now.\nE\nGrasping outsider treasure-hunter, Monster attracted by the resource, Resource-maker using it to gain sinister influence and power\nF\nEarnest prospector, Luckless official charged with gathering the resource, Desperate fortune-hunter\nC\nThe resource is cursed or dangerous, The resource can’t be accessed without some kind of agreement with the natives, The resource is sacred to the ruin’s dwellers\nT\nHidden cache of the resource, Device that extracts it, Ultra-rare refined example of the resource\nP\nPlace where the resource is extracted, Fortified zone around the extraction, Vault for the gathered resource\nRecruiting Drive §\nAt least one group of inhabitants in the ruin are actively adding to their numbers. This may involve bribes, kidnapping, proselytization, or just the prospect of a better life than their recruits currently have. This group is likely ideological or circumstantial in their ties, like a cult, a rebel group, or a bandit clan, and so new members can be added as quickly as they prove agreeable or profitable to the whole. Those who refuse to join in tend to meet less comradely fates.\nE\nCharismatic and ruthless conqueror, Heartless grandee hiring disposable muscle, Hypnotically persuasive cult leader\nF\nUnwilling recruit, Rival group’s leader, Local ruler worried about the new members\nC\nThe group recruits under false pretenses and then traps the new recruits in some crime, The group really is offering a better deal than most recruits have, Resentment is building between old and new group members\nT\nProof of some outside power’s involvement, Wealth meant to use to entice recruits, Rich gift given by an eager new recruit\nP\nDisordered and confused living quarters, Well-trod training area, Empty home of a now-vanished recruit\nRaider Lair §\nSome ruins are dangerous only to intruders, but this one actively sends out raiding parties to plunder the surroundings. Many such lairs prefer to go relatively far afield to obscure their origins and avoid the hostility of their immediate neighbors. Others have specific grudges to nurse, or particular targets that have incurred their wrath. Hostages might be taken back for ransom, labor, or food, depending on the nature of the inhabitants.\nE\nAmbitious bandit chieftain, Embittered exiled lord, Monstrous ruler who hungers for outside wealth\nF\nRelative of a kidnapped victim, Escapee from the raiders, Local reeve trying to cope with the raids\nC\nThe raiders are being backed by an outside power hostile to its neighbors, The raiders exact a brutal tribute for their “protection”, The raiders had or have a sympathetic cause\nT\nPriceless relic taken by the raiders, Cache of supplies they need badly, Loot hidden by the plunderers\nP\nRaucous and vile raider camp, Re-purposed room turned into the chief’s lair, Treasure chamber full of looted goods\nReligious Zealots §\nAlmost everyone has some degree of deference to the gods, but the natives of this ruin are outright fanatics of a particular religious or philosophical cause. They may have inherited from ages of ancestors, acquired it from the teachings of a charismatic prophet, or been persuaded of it by some profitable or terrifying display of divine will. The natives likely have at least one goal that makes no logical sense, but is related to their god’s nature or desires.\nE\nFrothingly intense high priest, Holy demon or sending of the god, Monstrous entity placated by the group’s worship\nF\nMember having second thoughts, Missionary of a rival faith, Cynical group member who wants to depose the current leadership in their favor\nC\nThe god’s intervention seems real on some level, Their cult is an offshoot of the locally dominant faith, They have backing from a mother temple\nT\nPrecious religious relic or regalia, Object blessed with divine powers, Wealth taken from unworthy unbelievers\nP\nRoom fitted out as an ornate shrine, Chamber carved with religious symbolism, Place dedicated to some bloody or fearsome ritual\nRigid Hierarchy §\nMost ruins have little organization, with various groups or lone beasts vying with each other as their strength allows. In this one, however, there is a clear and recognized hierarchy of power and authority, and lesser groups and entities are likely to obey the greater even without an immediate threat of violence. Of course, those same groups are also quite likely to conspire with outsiders to remove their vexations.\nE\nIron-fisted monster lord, Ambitious and scheming chieftain, Secret kingmaker working as a humble minion\nF\nHapless outsider slave, Minion with ambition, Bitter native seeking systemic revenge\nC\nThe current leader is the only one holding back the ruin’s denizens from raiding, The groups are being organized by an outside power, The subordinate groups are extremely bitter and restive over the state of affairs\nT\nTreasure used to pay off underlings, Potent artifact used to cow subordinates, Tribute extracted from unwilling inferiors\nP\nBarbarically luxurious throne room, Disciplined and organized watch post, Labor zone where the inferiors toil\nSacrificial Bargain §\nThe natives of the ruin have made some kind of pact with a dread power or sinister force, receiving support or power in exchange for some sacrifice. This sacrifice might fall directly on the natives themselves or they might plunder their neighbors for wealth, human sacrifices, or such other resources as their patron demands in payment. Failure to hold up their end of the deal may be fatal to the inhabitants.\nE\nMalevolent high priest of a dark power, Envoy of a ruthless foe of the local inhabitants, Frantic leader driven to desperate bargains\nF\nSacrificial victim who escaped, Foe of the patron power searching for its catspaws, Native from a rival group that’s being beaten down\nC\nThe bargain seemed an innocent one at first, They‘re realizing that they can’t hold up the deal, The deal was made without the consent of the group’s ordinary members\nT\nObject that symbolizes and empowers the pact, Wealth granted by the patron, Precious object lost by a sacrificial victim\nP\nTerrible chamber of ritual offering, Local homestead ravaged by raiders, Storehouse or living area made abundant by the patron\nRoyal Refuge §\nSome exiled noble, unsuccessful pretender, hunted wizard, or other grandee of note remained here for a time, either willingly or under duress. They and their retinue left their traces behind, and remnants of the group might still be present. The principle figure probably died here, though some kinds of creatures or wizards may have been less susceptible to time.\nE\nUndead prince in exile, Royal agent convinced the PCs are allies of the rebel here, New usurper claiming the dead one’s mantle or name\nF\nWell-meaning servant of the royal, Local chief trying to keep his village out of the affair, Sympathetic exile in need of help\nC\nThe royal tried to make a deal with the creatures here, The royal had secret ties or perhaps even was one of the natives here, The royal’s foes are in sudden need of proof of their death\nT\nItem proving the royal’s legitimacy, National treasure they stole away with them, Book full of blackmail material they recorded\nP\nTattered but once-ornate chamber they occupied, Cache full of carefully-preserved noble regalia, Pathetic and coarsely-monumented grave site\nSealed Evil §\nThe ruin serves as a prison for some terribly dangerous entity or power. It may have been originally designed to serve such a purpose, or retrofitted by later inhabitants due to a sudden need, or possibly even mistaken for some other kind of structure by innocent discoverers of a later era. Something about the evil makes it exceptionally hard to kill or permanently destroy, so imprisoning it “forever” seemed wiser.\nE\nUndead immortal sorcerer, Monstrous and nigh-unkillable creature, Arch-Outsider with a biology humans can’t be sure is dead\nF\nHereditary warden of the prison, Innocently eager explorer, Ancestral hunter of the evil\nC\nThe evil was actually a benign entity or is currently mistaken for one, Those who loose it will gain enormous power, It’s being tapped for power in a way that risks freeing it\nT\nRelic of the dark power’s evil, Seal on the creature that’s an extremely valuable item in itself, Valuable material created or generated by the prison as a byproduct\nP\nExceedingly well-sealed prison area, Chamber with a temporal stasis cell, Hall full of warning iconography made inscrutable by time\nSecret Alliance §\nThe natives of the ruin have a secret deal or arrangement with some outside power, doing their bidding or providing some special service in exchange for considerations. It might be a corrupt ruler, a sinister cult, an Outsider lord, a backwater hamlet chief, or some other figure that wouldn’t wish the arrangement to become public.\nE\nMerchant with vile black market deals, Official who wants the ruin to remain a problem, Society grandee with sinister appetites\nF\nSuspicious noble investigator, Stern inquisitor from the local temple, Local who knows too much\nC\nThe deal is maintaining a fragile peace, There’s an openly-acknowledged deal with them but the real bargain is far more sinister, One side is getting ready to betray the other\nT\nProof of the alliance, Rich plunder taken from an ally’s enemy, Relic the mutual cooperation is meant to obtain\nP\nSecret meeting place in the wilds, Chamber for an envoy of the ally, Treasure chamber with goods from the ally\nSpatial Flux §\nSpace within the ruin has been folded, altered, or corrupted in some way, either by ancient magics, inauspicious geomancy, the depredations of a dimensional monster, failed Workings, fumbled sorcery, or some other woe. Some creatures may use the curdled space as a refuge from their enemies, while others might use it as a gate to some stranger and more terrible place.\nE\nTransdimensional abomination, Mad sorcerer making things worse, Obsessive seeker of some hidden grail within the spatial maze\nF\nFriendly xenodimensional, Adventurer lost and trapped within the place, Local citizen accidentally caught in a warp\nC\nThe destinations of the warps can be controlled from within the ruin, The place’s architecture is only physically possible with spatial distortions, The warps lead to different times as well as places\nT\nRelic that creates or influences warps, Treasure shifted here from an alternate place or world, Wealth physically duplicated by the warps\nP\nEscher-like room, Chamber with physical locations split over vast differences, Featureless hall that really never ends\nShifting Interior §\nThe interior of the ruin is not stable, and shifts and alters over time or through some enigmatic cycle. It may be composed of constantly-moving elements of some ancient megastructure, or be spatially distorted by a decaying Working, or infested with inhabitants that are constantly rebuilding or reworking the layout. The natives may have some key knowledge that lets them navigate the changes.\nE\nTransdimensional intruder entity, Berserk master of the rebuilders, Sinister exile using the place as a refuge\nF\nFriendly native guide, Relative of one lost in the labyrinth, Frustrated builder in need of help\nC\nThe shifts encode an important secret, If the shifts are interrupted a catastrophe will ensue, The shifts are under the control of the ruin’s master\nT\nKey to control the shifts, Map of the alterations, The treasure within the labyrinth’s heart\nP\nRoom that’s changed from the last time they saw it, Churning death zone of moving perils, Maze of twisty little passages all alike\nSurfacer Hideout §\nSome surface power is using the ruin as a hideout or base of operations. While they may simply be bandits or refugees, they’re more likely agents of some greater power who need a discreet base, or some cult or criminal organization that needs a safe place to hide from the law. Friendly merchants or other associates might make contact with them there to provide for necessities, or they could be working to survive entirely separate from the hostile world outside.\nE\nForeign spy chief, Cult high priest, Ruthless hunter of an innocent group that’s hiding here\nF\nElder of a despised ethnic group hiding here, Government investigator of the ruin, Local who lives nearby and has seen suspicious things\nC\nRather than displacing the monstrous natives the surfacers have dominated or co-opted them, The surfacers were killed or driven out of the ruin very recently and their effects remain, The surfacers have hidden so well that they no longer understand the situation above\nT\nTreasure brought from afar by the surfacers, Loot gathered up from displaced ruin natives, Some precious good crafted or extracted by surfacers\nP\nRoom reminiscent of home, Carefully-hidden entrance to their zone, Remote meeting place\nTaboo Place §\nThe locals surrounding the ruin consider it taboo, and will kill or punish anyone who enters it without their permission. This may be the product of religious reverence, or it could be a holy place of their ancestors, or it could be disputed territory, or it may be that the last time adventurers went in a catastrophe came out. Objects looted from the place will be very hard to sell discreetly anywhere near it.\nE\nRelentless leader of the guardians, The monstrous thing within that must not be disturbed, Ruin raider who will cause chaos with their plundering\nF\nEarnest young treasure hunter, Native who doesn’t believe in the taboo, Local who desperately needs to get inside for some reason\nC\nThe locals are absolutely right that meddling with the place will bring disaster on them, The ruin somehow marks those who profane it, The ruin can be entered lawfully under some special circumstance or by certain people\nT\nPass to allow lawful entrance, Unsellably distinct treasure from the place, Device to overcome the watchfulness of the guardians\nP\nExemplary warning-pike with heads attached, Long-sealed entrance portal, Vigilant guardpost\nUseless Treasure §\nThe ruin was once a carefully-guarded storehouse of some substance or information that was priceless at the time but is now largely worthless. Obscure materials, Outsider goods of no present use, exotic matter fashioned by sorcery and of forgotten purposes, and critical intelligence on empires long since dust might all be found here.\nE\nTireless immortal guardian, Brutally relentless treasure seeker, Maddened sorcerer trying to unlock the “real value” of the treasure\nF\nMistakenly optimistic adventurer, Seeker with a lost key to the wards, Native denizen who knows the treasure is worthless\nC\nThe natives may prize the stuff even if the world outside doesn’t, The treasure really is valuable to the very few who know how to use it, The useless treasure is cased with then-useless material that is priceless now\nT\nTremendously well-guarded dross, Text showing how to use the treasure, Key for suppressing the treasure’s security system\nP\nVast vault full of garbage, Guard post manned by undying watchers, Ancient luxury area featuring the material or the wealth it brought them\nThings Below §\nThe ruin delved too deep, or opened too many doors to other realms, and things came boiling out that brought its destruction. Those things may have fallen asleep again, or returned to their realm, or yet remained here waiting for fresh prey. They may come and go based on particular time cycles, or when provoked by certain rituals or activities within the place.\nE\nLovecraftian abomination from below, Alien-minded extraplanar conqueror, Cultist leader who reveres these eldritch powers\nF\nHistorian seeking more truth about the things, Relative of a victim of the things, Eager explorer who doesn’t believe in the things\nC\nThe things are associated with monstrous tides of dangerous vermin, The treasures to be had from delving are almost worth the risk, The treasures were actually living things that ruined the place\nT\nPrecious object brought from below, The treasure that they were delving up, Wealth left behind by the suddenly-slain natives\nP\nInterrupted digging site, Vault laden with the wealth of below, Site of sudden terrible ruin\nWizard’s Lair §\nWizards often require an emphatic degree of privacy to ward off importunate help-seekers, witch hunters, rivals in the art, or reckless thieves. This ruin is or once was a lair to one such wizard, who probably isn’t inclined to view visitors kindly. Even the dead ones may have left behind half-finished Workings and unaging automaton servitors to guard their venerable lore and precious magical relics.\nE\nImmortal and heartless wizard, Monstrous creation of a dead mage, Modern sorcerer exploiting the lair of a dead archmage\nF\nWell-meaning apprentice, Escapee from one of their experiments, Vengeful mage-hunter\nC\nThey perform some service vital to the locals but at a terrible price, No one’s heard from them for so long that it’s thought they’re dead, It’s actually a lair for a school or cabal of wizards\nT\nPrecious sorcerous grimoire, Magical item crafted there, Vast wealth given by petitioners\nP\nChamber with a half-finished and dangerous Working, Pens for alchemical monstrosities, Living quarters that are physically impossible somehow"},"Toolbox/WWN/Worlds-Without-Number-Tags---Wilderness-Tags":{"title":"Worlds Without Number Tags - Wilderness Tags","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Abandoned Village §\nWilderness villages tend to be unstable “gold rush” settlements in the best of times, attracting those who lack any sound place elsewhere. This village failed as rapidly as it was formed. It may have been overrun by marauders, depopulated by disease, hollowed out by a failed harvest, torn apart by civil strife, or just abandoned for better prospects elsewhere.\nE\nBandit chief or sorcerer responsible for the ruin, Crazed village head turned hermit, Monstrous entity nesting in the remains\nF\nLast stubborn holdout, Lord’s bailiff looking for answers, Hapless pioneer who’s arrived to an empty ruin\nC\nIt’s now populated by something inhuman, It was built on top of a place abandoned for good reason, The wilderness is reclaiming it in a dangerous way\nT\nHeirloom left behind in the flight, Buried treasure of the villagers, The relic that caused the ruin\nP\nOvergrown village meeting hall, Home with everything left just as it was at that moment, Burnt-out shrine to the local god\nAncient Monument §\nA grand monument to some ancient polity is found here. While its actual meaning and significance may be inscrutable, it’s probably big enough and dramatic enough to dominate the hex, even if it’s collapsed or been defaced by the ages. The remains of the civilization that raised it might be found at its base, along with whatever heirs to it remain. Some monuments still have active enchantments or guardians to prevent defacement.\nE\nZealous modern cultist of the vanished polity, Last bitter heir of them, Vile monster that nests in the monument\nF\nEager archaeologist, Weary old hereditary keeper of the place, Friendly creature that’s made the monument a home\nC\nThe monument is a powerful Working, The monument served a secular or residential purpose, The bulk of the monument is underground or in an extradimensional pocket Iterum\nT\nCostly decorations or ornaments on the monument, The precious core of the work, Ancient offerings made to it by vanished supplicants\nP\nBefore some towering megastructure-monument, Amid the cyclopean wreckage of its fall, Secret passages within the monument\nAncient Guardians §\nThere are guardians in this site derived from some ancient polity, whether constructs built to protect some long-forgotten place here or the restless shades of the dead who once dwelled in the location. They may have a simple hatred towards “invaders” or they may be confused, thinking interlopers are part of some ancient enemy group. What they once guarded may not even exist any more in any perceptible way.\nE\nUnrelenting golem leader, Maddened sorcerer-lord shade, Sinister heir seeking to suborn the guardians to their service\nF\nDiplomatic guardian entity, Greedy treasure-hunter, Local who got trapped in the place\nC\nThe guardians are to keep something in, A local group uses the guardians as a trap for outsiders, The guardians were never meant to be harmful but what they do to intruders is very damaging\nT\nKey to shut down or ward off the guardians, The precious relic they were guarding, Ritual garb that makes the wearer invisible to the guardians\nP\nPlace of ominously martial statuary, Ghostly street-image of a vanished place, Broken remnant of an ancient landmark\nArratu Land §\nThere is a large pocket of arratu at the site, even though it may be too small to show up on the hex map. Such a pocket might be the last remnant of a formerly-great swath, or it could just be a localized tumor created by an Outsider device, a malevolent sorcerer, or a magical disaster. Something about the arratu’s placement likely forces the party to go well out of their way to bypass it safely; it might command a narrow pass or be flanked by dangerous terrain on either side.\nE\nOutsider beast within the waste, Half-human marauder chief lairing inside, Crazed Outsider wizard who made the wasteland\nF\nFoolish explorer who tried to cross it, Wretched slave taken by raiders, Not-too-homicidal native\nC\nThe wasteland is being contained by a potentially-breakable object here, Locals know how to get through it safely, It’s a very new wasteland and the locals haven’t adjusted to it yet\nT\nEquipment to survive the hostile atmosphere within, Precious Outsider relic, Wealth seized by raiders from the waste\nP\nBlasted village overrun by alien life, Desolate plain with an unearthly sky above, Lakeshore of a pool filled with a noxious chemical\nBandit Lair §\nBandits lair in this hex, which is presumably close enough to civilized lands to serve as a base for their operations. Not every bandit lair is a hidden cave; some operate out of subverted or cowed villages, others hide among remote monasteries, and some just camp in convenient glades long enough to rest, refit, and trade with black marketeers. It might be a seasonal lair as well, with local peasants turning bandit at certain profitable times of the year.\nE\nRuthlessly pragmatic bandit chief, Wealthy grandee wielding the bandits against rivals, Heartless slaver gathering stock\nF\nHapless missionary of a kinder way, Local taken as a slave, Runaway bandit who repents\nC\nThey have a traditional prey and don’t usually rob others, They’re the degenerate remnants of a once-noble cause, They’re a confederacy of thieving groups that often quarrel\nT\nLoot taken from a recent success, Priceless heirloom owned by a noble-turned-bandit, Precious relic the bandits don’t realize is so valuable\nP\nRaucous glade full of drink and debauchery, Re-purposed estate, Makeshift palisaded camp\nBlighted Tribe §\nA tribe of Blighted live in the hex. They may be violent war-creatures naturally hostile to normal humanity or beings cursed with some trait or nature that makes it impossible for them to live in civilization. Relations are unlikely to be warm in either case, but the latter might be persuaded to parley if the party can work around their limitations and win their trust.\nE\nBrutal Blighted war-chief, Outsider using them as living tools, Human hunter bent on slaughtering inoffensive Blighted\nF\nNative not so Blighted as their brethren, Human trader who deals with them, Local human who knows their ways\nC\nTheir blight was once very useful to the ancient polity that existed here, They’re only Blighted because they lack something to temper it that this site once provided, They’re dying out and desperate to win allies against their many predators\nT\nValuable Blighted-made product, Relics of those who twisted them, Trophies taken from their prey\nP\nHuman structure reworked to fit their nature, Site of a gruesome massacre, Shrine or monument honoring their creators\nBeast Swarm §\nThere is a swarm of some dangerous beast in the area, whether it consists of a tide of minuscule vermin or a pack of magically-warped predators. Some of these swarms may serve more as environmental hazards than monsters to be fought; sweeping carpets of mutated radioactive fire ants might be something for the PCs to dodge rather than engage. If the beasts have some mundane value, they might have attracted suitably reckless interest from the locals.\nE\nSupernaturally intelligent god-beast, Mad wizard who spawned them, Brutal hunt master driving his wretched minions on\nF\nVictim of a beast attack, Animal collector on a mission, Hunter in search of vengeance\nC\nThe beasts are usually harmless but have recently changed, The beasts are the only thing holding a worse peril back, The beasts gain magical powers in sufficiently large groups\nT\nPoison that is very lethal to the beasts, Relic that can control the swarms, Priceless treasure held by a luckless hunter\nP\nSite of a bestial massacre, Fetid den of a swarm, Overrun hunter’s camp\nBroken Infrastructure §\nThere is a ruin here that once enabled some grand ancient infrastructure. A lost canal lock, irrigation control center, magical gate nexus, weather control station, underground transit station, occult communications center, or some other great function was once performed here. The ruin has been unusable for ages, but remnants of its former function might still be found in the surroundings.\nE\nSorcerer looting the wreckage, Monstrous remnant of the former inhabitants or guardians, Modern parasite-monster come to feed on the scraps\nF\nCurious arcane student, Tribal who lives in the ruin, Wayfarer forced to seek refuge there\nC\nIt still works but in a dangerous and unhelpful way, It would cause a tremendous local disaster if it were re-activated, The locals are exploiting it in an unintended fashion\nT\nControl key for the original function, Relic related to the original function that does something magical, Precious component from it\nP\nLong-ruined control nexus, Collapsed service or operational area, Surrounding area scarred by the decayed remnants of its function\nChokepoint §\nThere’s a natural choke point in this area: a mountain pass, a land bridge, a dry ridge in a swamp, a narrow strand of untainted arratu land, a gap in a megastructure, or some other slender passage. Such a chokepoint is likely part of a feature that extends outside the hex, and it may be prohibitively difficult to cross this feature anywhere else. Such valuable, defensible areas are rarely left unoccupied.\nE\nBandit lord who “taxes” passersby, Monstrous creature who hunts there, Ancient guardian of a long-dead polity\nF\nTrader in dire need, Explorer seeking a better way, Local currently inhabiting the chokepoint\nC\nIt can be opened or blocked by a controller, It’s only recently become abnormally dangerous, It’s known of only by those who want it kept secret\nT\nMap of the passage, Token allowing safe passage, Key to controlling the passage\nP\nPerfect ambush site, Natural fortress, High observation point commanding the pass\nCriminal Meet §\nThis site is used as a meeting place for smugglers, bandits, illegal slavers, fences, or other criminals. Something about the place gives them a good view of any incoming strangers and discreet privacy for their dealings. Some few criminals may remain here at all times to maintain the place, or it might be used only as the situation requires. These criminals may be particular, dealing only with known associates, or they may be far enough from the law to feel comfortable about trading with adventurers.\nE\nCorrupt merchant grandee, Sinister black market boss, Monstrous entity that enforces the meet’s peace\nF\nTheft victim searching for their goods, Frustrated local lawman, Merchant with suspicions about a fence\nC\nThe local authorities turn a knowing blind eye to it, The meet is trading in something much worse than everyone thinks it is, Significant amounts of stolen goods are stored there\nT\nValuable smuggled contraband, Cache of stolen goods, Precious object that’s very hard to fence\nP\nConcealed cave storehouse, Rocky observation point, Sheltered glade in a thick forest\nCollapsed Deep §\nAn ancient Deep once was located here, but time, warfare, or disaster caused it to collapse. A significant portion of the surface has likely subsided to form an uneven crater. Small sections of the Deep might still be accessible from the surface, and dangerous uncollapsed passageways may still connect these smaller zones. The heirs of the survivors may still persist on the surface or they may have long since died out to natural hazards or dispersion.\nE\nBuried undying lord, Surface looter with dreams of rule, The thing that caused the collapse\nF\nFriendly survivor descendant, Curious explorer, Native guide to the ancient pit\nC\nThings below are digging their way up, The Deep is leaking something dangerous, The collapse was recent and monstrous survivors still flee\nT\nPriceless Deep treasure cast up, Exposed arcane components, Potent relic carried by survivors\nP\nAncient vault torn in two, Crevasse cutting through a hundred ruined levels, Buckled structure fragment jutting through the surface\nCryptic Art §\nA vast ancient work of art has been raised here, back when the wilderness was not so wild. It may be a statue or other sculpted monument, perhaps of entities in no way human, or it may be fashioned of solid light, sound, emotions, or stranger media. The intended meaning of this art is usually incomprehensible to modern humanity and the structure is too large or too difficult to harm for ordinary vandals or time to have erode it entirely. Some ancient forms of art can be dangerous or even lethal to modern humans.\nE\nAncient site guardian, Priest of a cult that’s made a religion of the art, Sorcerer bent on suborning a magical artwork\nF\nReckless art connoisseur, Native living in the artwork, Historian trying to decipher it\nC\nIt has a positive or negative effect on a viewer’s body or mind, It’s been warped into something monstrous by time or decay, It encodes a terrible or precious secret to those who understand it\nT\nAncient texts that can decode the art’s meaning, Precious object used in its construction, Fragment of damaged art that’s still valuable\nP\nIntended viewing site for the art, Churning inner mechanism of a complex work, Hidden chamber revealing a different perspective of the work\nCursed Land §\nThis site has been cursed. Rather than being a simple xenoformed arratu, some malevolent magic has laid a persistent, dangerous affliction on the area. Creatures may be warped, inhabitants may be plagued, terrible luck might strike all passers-by, or natural physical processes might be perverted. There should be something valuable or attractive here, or else few people would have any reason to engage with the location.\nE\nVile sorcerer responsible for the curse, Hideously-warped native creature, Curse-beast that sweats the malison with its very existence\nF\nLocal curse victim, Native sorcerer trying to lift it, Hapless pioneer who didn’t realize it was there\nC\nIt has a seemingly positive effect as well, The seemingly obvious source of the curse isn’t at all responsible, Someone profits by the curse\nT\nWard to protect against the curse, Precious byproduct of the magic, Key to undoing the curse\nP\nWarped and twisted natural feature, Nest of misshapen beasts, Field of grossly-mutated plant life\nDemihuman Community §\nThere’s a community of demihumans living here, likely intentionally avoiding more well-controlled lands in order to maintain their autonomy. Autonomy alone is unlikely to be all the reason they’ve avoided civilized lands, however, as few human rulers find it worth the trouble to demand more than a fixed tribute from demihumans, leaving them to control their own affairs. There may be something about this group that makes it impossible for them to live comfortably near humans.\nE\nCrazed demihuman leader, Sinister demihuman cult priest, Tyrannical government viceroy\nF\nXenophilic local demihuman, Human trader with lasting ties, Human who’s “gone native”\nC\nThey’re apart to keep humans safe from them rather than them safe from humans, They’re remnants of a former demihuman kingdom, They’re responsible for many local wilderness dangers in order to maintain their privacy\nT\nPrecious good created by demihumans, Inherited relic of the ancestors, Tribute owed the local ruler\nP\nCeremonial structure of a former age, Village hidden cunningly, Well-guarded wall against outsiders\nDecayed Working §\nThere’s an ancient Working in the area that is broken or decayed, and the original effect it was intended to produce has been twisted into something dangerous. Infrastructure Workings meant to provide good fortune, health, or swift travel might now create ill-luck, plagues, or vomit forth extradimensional horrors. Small Workings of private buildings might now create localized hazards. Completely destroying the Working might end the problem or create an even greater disaster from the magical fallout.\nE\nWorking-born abomination, Ancient caretaker gone berserk, Sorcerer tearing apart the Working recklessly for lore and parts\nF\nNative who knows how to live with the blight, Ambitious would-be repairman, Curious scholar looking for details\nC\nThe decay can be contained with vile or costly rituals by the locals, The decay is endured because it fends off outsiders, A local enemy wants to worsen the effect\nT\nParts to repair the Working, Valuable magical byproducts, Precious Working fragments\nP\nDecaying Working chamber, Site twisted by the magical effect, Collapsed arcane structure\nDevil Grove §\nWhile not a full-fledged arratu, there’s a glade or zone within the hex that’s infested with Outsider flora and fauna. Beasts from within prowl the surrounding area, though some circumstance is preventing the glade from growing at a very rapid pace. Some ancient Outsider device may be causing the glade, or it might be the tiny remnant of some ancient wasteland that’s shrunken with time and the constraint of the Legacy.\nE\nHideous Outsider predator, Blighted warchief hiding in the grove, Ancient Outsider maintaining the grove\nF\nHard-pressed pioneer, Local hunter harried by the beasts, Adventurer seeking the grove’s cause\nC\nLocal rustics sacrifice to the grove to placate its denizens, The grove is valued as a natural defense against a neighboring threat, Exiles and criminals seek refuge there\nT\nPrecious byproduct of alien life, Outsider relic in the heart of the grove, Valuable goods on a victim of the beasts\nP\nGlen swollen with uncanny life, Windy vale streaked with plumes of alien air, Shore of a pond full of some noxious chemical\nDisused Mine §\nA mine of some kind once existed here. While shaft mines with tunnels and galleries are the common type for present-day delvings, ancient strip mines here may have peeled off whole mountainsides or exposed some massive megastructure that was stripped for parts in a prior, lost age. The forgotten mines of a prior era might have left tailing piles or trace deposits that are valuable to a more depleted age.\nE\nCrazed wildcat miner, Thing from delving too deep, Undead and tireless mine boss\nF\nEager prospector, Native dwelling in the mines, Ancient friendly mining automaton\nC\nThey were mining a buried civilization rather than ores, Groups are fighting over control of the mine, The mine was partially re-purposed for the needs of a group of natives\nT\nMotherlode of precious materials, Storehouse of refined product, Map to a virgin strike\nP\nMassive pitch-black subterranean gallery, Mound made of centuries worth of tailings, Still-poisoned land in a processing waste zone\nHermitage §\nA small hermitage was established here sometime in the past to provide solitude for some ascetic. Occasionally small clusters of hermits form around such a central point, meeting at times to check on each other or join in shared discipline. Such anchorites usually shun visitors who aren’t also devotees of their path, but occasionally a hermit wins such fame for sorcery or wisdom that pilgrims seek them out. Some hermits have been known to respond with great anger toward these repeated worldly interruptions.\nE\nHermit sorcerer gone mad, Sinister villain hiding as a hermit, Alien hermit with inscrutably evil philosophical principles\nF\nWorried relative of a new hermit, Petitioner seeking holy help, Hermit rethinking solitude\nC\nThe hermits have control over a local magical energy or Working, They keep themselves separate to keep others safe from them and their irrepressible powers, The hermit is hated by the local secular authorities for their aid to its foes\nT\nPrecious religious relic carried by the hermit, Cast-off worldly wealth, Map to finding them\nP\nAustere wilderness cave, Hermit hole in a grave-mound in the swamps, Tall and narrow stone column for sitting on\nHealing Terrain §\nThis site borders a shrinking arratu, one being slowly driven back by the Legacy, the work of human hands, or some native life form that’s capable of successfully competing with the alien life. There are usually some pioneers or scavengers trying to take advantage of the shrinking waste, either to work the newly-arable land or plunder the ruins its receding tide reveals.\nE\nFurious and frustrated Outsider wastemaker, Monstrous beast in too small a hunting ground, Local tyrant seeking dominion over the new pioneers\nF\nPlucky new colonist, Earnest professional mender of wastes, Luckless soldier sent to defend the new locals\nC\nThe shrinking wastes are revealing a lost human city below, As the waste shrinks its effects are getting more concentrated inside it, The receding zone is opening a safe path for old enemies to strike the new holdings\nT\nTreasures long lost within the waste, Possessions cherished by a now-dead pioneer, Precious product of the alien flora that now grows scarce\nP\nHalf-warped glade where alien life is losing, Newly-built steading, Exposed ancient structure\nHistorical Survival §\nSome small community or remnant group of an ancient empire persists here. They may have been a colony planted before the empire’s fall, an outside group that inherited the culture after conquest or subsumption, a chronological distortion cast out of time, a group held in stasis that recently awoke, or some other remnant of a greater past. They may or may not have a clear idea of the present world, but may preserve knowledge of now-lost strongholds and points of power once held by their ancestors.\nE\nEmbittered revanchist ruler, Vengeful chieftain who blames the world, Transhuman leader of incomprehensible cognition\nF\nHeritor curious about outsiders, Desperate chief in need of outside help, Determined preserver of ancient identity\nC\nThe empire they belonged to was infamous, They’re only notionally human, They make deals with rebels and exiles of neighboring lands\nT\nLong-preserved ancient regalia, Now-lost relic in common use in their empire, Secret lore to unlock hidden storehouses of their people\nP\nCrumbling and dilapidated public building, Crude shrine with too-advanced salvaged ornaments, Passages kept secret from the world\nIsolated Academy §\nA school of sorcerers, esoteric artists, hermit-scholars, or other educators is in the area. The place might once have been the heart of the ancient city where the academy was founded, or it may have special magical or aesthetic traits to attract practitioners, or the topic they study might be abhorrent to civilization. The academy is likely largely self-sufficient but its students and teachers doubtless retain some ties to the outer world.\nE\nSinister headmaster, Powerful instructor with a dark purpose, Monstrous thing the academy serves\nF\nSympathetic young student, Pilgrim aspiring to be admitted, Harried instructor needing help\nC\nIt has two curricula with the second being much darker and known only to initiates, It’s protected by its terrible patron power, An awful sacrifice is demanded of some or all students\nT\nTome of secret lore they’ve developed, Magical object they’ve created, Key to bypassing the academy’s defenses\nP\nMundanely-impossible lecture hall, Artistic work of inhuman nature, Site scorched and blasted by their mistakes or training errors\nLost Battlefield §\nA terrible battle was fought here at some point in the past, perhaps before the wilderness became what it is now. The locals may or may not remember the event, but the battle left some pronounced effect on the area. Undead may be exceptionally common here, or an ancient weapon may have curdled the land, or the automatons that fought here may still be watchful for new enemies.\nE\nLooter-archaeologist and his minions, Undying warlord, Relentless ancient automaton\nF\nCurious scholar from afar, Heir to one of the warring sides, Ancestral caretaker of the field\nC\nThe battle is reenacted by locals either ritually or in earnest every so often, A priceless item of ruling regalia was lost here, The battlefield’s full of unexploded ancient munitions\nT\nPotent weapon of ancient days, Precious treasure carried here by a slain noble warrior, Bones of a sainted hero revered by the locals\nP\nHasty and makeshift tomb of a war leader, Land churned up by ancient war magic, Vast burial mound amid a bleak plain\nLabyrinthine Tangle §\nThe terrain is remarkably tangled and treacherous, such that it’s almost impossible to cross it without a guide or very good map. This tangle may be the result of shifting, boggy ground, wildly overgrown forest, looming cliffs that box in travel, or magical miasmas that baffle and disorient. Some regions might have spatial distortions born of ancient magic, such that only the right keys allow outsiders to pass them.\nE\nSinister master of the labyrinth, Monstrous creature born of the wild, Savage exile hiding in the maze\nF\nHelpful local guide, Hapless soul lost within it, Friendly native of the maze\nC\nGetting lost in it can leave you very far from your entry point, An environmental hazard harms you more the longer you stay in it, Guides sacrifice certain clients to the powers within\nT\nMap of the labyrinth, Treasure lost by a victim within it, Precious object the labyrinth guards\nP\nTrail that looks like all the rest, Trees or cliffs too difficult to scale blocking out any distant view, Ancient megastructure with perfectly identical massive decorative fragments that form a maze\nLost City §\nThere was a city here once and its remnants can still be found through the overgrowth. It may have been an ancient city of some lost empire, or it could be a community more recently destroyed by some event and consumed by the surrounding wilderness. In the former case it’s probably forgotten by all but the wisest scholars, while in the latter there’s some pressing reason that its former people don’t dare approach its site any more.\nE\nThe terrible creature that destroyed it, Vengeful wraith of its last ruler, Savage chieftain who’s taken it for his seat of rule\nF\nShy survivor of the original population, Local native who dares to enter it, Ancient city servitor who still functions\nC\nThe city is plagued with magical aftershocks of the mighty sorcery that destroyed it, The city was smashed before its inhabitants could do a great evil, It’s taboo ground for the nearby locals\nT\nAncient city vault’s treasures, Precious relic of the dead, Fragment of the thing that ruined it\nP\nDesolate street half-buried by earth and decay, City monument worn into illegibility, Wreckage of the catastrophic death of the city\nMagical Springs §\nThere’s an enchanted spring in the area, one empowered by an ancient Working or warped by ambient currents of magic. The creatures that drink from it might be blessed with some special grace, but it’s just as likely that some more sinister consequence comes from imbibing its water. The animal and plant life around it have doubtless been substantially altered by its effects. Most such springwater loses its powers if separated from the main body for very long.\nE\nBeast warped by the spring’s power, Ruthless sorcerer experimenting with its effects, Barbaric chieftain using it to advance his power\nF\nAncestral guardian of the spring, Pioneer plagued by the spring’s effects, Scholar who thinks they can fix any negative effects of the spring\nC\nThe spring grants a blessing that comes with a substantial cost, The spring’s blessing becomes a curse when over-imbibed, The spring’s created an entire ecosystem of servitor-addicts\nT\nCure for the changes the spring forces, Vessel that can hold the springwater without losing its power, Precious fragment of the original Working\nP\nPool of obviously uncanny water, Shore marked with the spring’s effects, Weird den of a spring-touched beast\nMigration Path §\nA fearsome migration of dangerous creatures crosses this area at certain times of the month or year. During this migration an invincible wave of these entities crosses the site, perhaps to get from one underground entrance to another, or to move from one feeding site to the next, or to immerse themselves in some critical magical aura or ancient radiation. Despite this, there must be something valuable in this area that tempts outsiders to risk being here when the living tide arrives.\nE\nMonstrously huge alpha of the tide, Cultist who worships the creatures of the tide, Sorcerer trying to bend the swarm to his will\nF\nTreasure seeker daring the migration schedule, Scholar of these beasts, Local trapped here at the wrong time\nC\nThe tide’s schedule is dangerously unpredictable, The creatures are always present but only become dangerous during the migration, The migration path changes very often\nT\nPrecious animal byproduct of the swarm, Treasure found by a too-slow seeker, Key to predicting or controlling the swarm\nP\nTrail stripped bare by the tide, Massive breeding ground, Island full of cowering refugees\nMilitary Outpost §\nThere’s a military post located in this wilderness, one planted by an interested government, community, religion, or mercantile group. It may be guarding a trail through the wilds, monitoring dangerous natives, acting as a tripwire against invasion, or be a punishment post for troublesome officers. The outpost is likely to be reliant on regular shipments of goods. Sufficiently large outposts often form the nucleus of a pioneer settlement.\nE\nBrutal martinet commander, Wrathful native leader, Crime boss who’s suborned the isolated post\nF\nHard-used military scout, Pioneer searching for help, Native leader looking for allies\nC\nThe outpost has sparked a dispute with a bordering polity, The post is so isolated it’s effectively independent, The post has been abandoned or cut off by its patron and is in dire need of supply\nT\nLoad of vital supplies, Pay for the soldiers, Weapon shipment craved by the natives\nP\nRough-hewn log fort, Piled stone strongpoint on a naturally-defensible site, Tall wooden tower looking over the countryside\nMotherlode §\nSome precious ore, rare wood, magical elixir, arcanely-potent extract, or other natural product is in great supply here. Anyone capable of extracting it without interruption would become very wealthy, though the natives, the local fauna, or rival competitors may make that ambition difficult to fulfill. The motherlode might be known only to the natives, or is perhaps known to no one at all due to its concealment or exotic nature.\nE\nProspector devoid of moral qualms, Existing site owner who’s lethally paranoid, Local lord who intends to utterly exploit the eventual site owner\nF\nHumble laborer in the mines, Poor but talented prospector, Land-wise local who knows of it\nC\nThe substance is very hazardous to the extractor, Extracting it would break a very powerful local monopoly, It was buried or sealed away for a very good reason\nT\nSample proving the motherlode’s worth, Ancient tools that make extraction practical, Capital needed to begin extraction\nP\nThe dangerous extraction site itself, Cave where prior extractors stored their equipment, Makeshift barracks where the laborers sleep\nMonstrous Beast §\nFearsome beasts are a commonplace in the wilderness of the Latter Earth, but there’s something here horrible enough to be remarkable even to the natives. It may be something far too dangerous for the party to have any hope of defeating; if so, it should leave plenty of evidence of its approach or presence, and give prudent heroes the chance to flee or distract it. The natives either avoid this area or must find some way to placate the thing.\nE\nMagical abomination born of ancient sorcery, Divinely-infused god-beast, Remnant-creature of a dead empire that still fulfills its duty\nF\nGlory-seeking hunter, Native with a lust for vengeance against it, Rapt arcane zoologist\nC\nThe locals worship it as a god because it actually can and will help them at times, It’s guarding a particular site there, Its leavings or sheddings are a precious substance\nT\nTreasure of some luckless victim, Relic of the beast’s makers, Substance or device that can repel the beast\nP\nSite of a horrible slaughter, Monstrous lair full of remains, Gory offering-site where sacrifices are made to it\nNomad Camp §\nThere’s a regularly-used nomad camp site in the area, a stopping place for them and their kindred. The site likely has water, a defensible position, or religious significance to them. Depending on the time of year or current raiding activities the camp might be empty, but any random day presents some chance of a group of them seeking shelter here. Wandering encounters in this hex might very likely be with such nomads.\nE\nGlory-hungry nomad raid leader, Leader who plans on turning his people into sedentary conquerors, Vision-maddened sorcerer-priest of the nomads\nF\nPeace-minded rival of the nomad leader, Local victim of their raids, Former owner of the structure they’re now using as a camp\nC\nThe nomads are raiders or traders as profit suggests, The nomads are forced to move by some outside power, The camp is desperately needed by some local group for practical or religious reasons\nT\nLoot hidden in the camp, Trophy taken by the raiders, Tribute offered up to win their mercy\nP\nOnce-splendid chamber now scuffed and defaced, Vigilantly-guarded oasis, Makeshift shrine to the nomad god\nOutsider Enclave §\nA group of surviving Outsiders dwells in the area, a remnant of their former age of rule. They may rely on stealth or great isolation to preserve their numbers, or they might just be able to kill anyone who gets too close. The enclave is unlikely to have real ambitions of expansion or else it would have been wiped out by now, but it may preserve ancient relics or fell powers that could wreak havoc if used recklessly.\nE\nBitterly vengeful Outsider leader, Human traitor in league with the enclave, Hideous thing unleashed by the enclave\nF\nOutsider who sees profit in the PCs, Naively xenophilic human, Victim of Outsider raids\nC\nThe Outsiders want something that isn’t necessarily antagonistic to the PCs, They’ve only recently awoken from stasis or temporal displacement and are still exploring, They’re masquerading as a human group or have one as a front\nT\nPotent alien relic, Treasure collected from human thralls, Precious regalia of an alien king\nP\nFetid Outsider nest with a noxious atmosphere, Eerie abandoned ruins of their former day, Maintained shrine to an Outsider god\nPerilous Path §\nA danger-laden bridge, trail, skyway, spatial distortion, tunnel, ancient roadbed, or some other path in this area leads through an otherwise impenetrable obstacle or serves as the sole means of reaching some point of interest. This path should be fairly obvious to explorers, but its destination may not be clear. If the destination is inhabited, it might be guarded by the denizens, or there may be the remains of ancient wayposts that once served the traffic along the path.\nE\nRaubritter warrior demanding a toll, Vicious monster lairing on the path, Bandit chief lying in wait to ambush travelers\nF\nHelpful native path guide, Ancient maintenance laborer on the path, Explorer seeking the path\nC\nThe path is one-way only, The path has only recently opened up, The path can be controlled with a particular key or relic\nT\nMap of the path, Ancient relic used by the path’s builders, Key to unlock the path\nP\nAncient skyway stretching between mountaintops, Tunnel full of long-forgotten defensive traps, Transdimensional pathway through an eldritch wilderness\nOvergrown Tomb §\nA once-honored tomb lies here, forgotten or lost to the depredations of enemies. The structure is likely elaborate enough to be a building in its own right, or an excavation beneath some surface monument. The tomb may house a single glorious hero or be the resting place of an associated group, such as a particular noble lineage, the slain of a great battle, a lost city’s municipal ossuary, or some like grave.\nE\nLong-trapped undead king, Monstrous beast fat on old corpses, Necromancer jealous of his prizes\nF\nAncestral guardian of the tomb, Curious archaeologist, Last heir of the one entombed\nC\nIt was originally a different structure turned into a mass grave due to emergency need, It’s actually just a mass casualty incident in a structure, Someone’s mining the dead for their remains\nT\nPrecious funerary offerings, Regalia buried with a dead ruler, Text containing secrets lost to the present day\nP\nCrumbling monument to the dead, Fallen-in gravesite, Forest of gravestones\nPilgrimage Site §\nThere is some important monument, place, or structure here that attracts pilgrims from far away. It may be a holy site beloved of a local faith, a mythic origin-point for a nearby culture, an oracle or other provider of widely-desired services, or a font of some special favor or benefit that can reward a pilgrim. The site may be under the control of a local government, or it may be too distant or dangerous to be effectively protected or administered by outsiders.\nE\nRaider chieftain plundering the pilgrims, Zealot who has seized control of it for their own sect, Once-benevolent holy entity that has become hostile for some reason\nF\nDesperate pilgrim from afar, Local administrator beset by woes, Young merchant providing for the pilgrims’ needs\nC\nFactions are actively struggling over the site’s control, The site is being ruined by the pilgrim traffic, The site has a strategic value quite aside from its use to pilgrims\nT\nSacred relic of the site, Offering given by a grateful pilgrim, Token that grants access to the site’s most potent reward\nP\nAncient temple on a holy site, Monument to a great deed, Perilous cave of an oracle\nPrecious Game §\nSome native fauna here is remarkably valuable, either for the sake of some magical blessing it grants its captor or for the benefits its flesh, pelt, or magical organs can give. Other game may be ritually important, such an animal that grants some ruling legitimacy to a successful hunter. The animal itself is probably either highly dangerous, highly rare, or carefully gamekept by some outside power if it has escaped extinction thus far.\nE\nBloodthirsty hunter who brooks no rivals, Game animal grown warped and lethal, Guardian of the game who kills all interlopers\nF\nSympathetic hunter with a good reason, Local deeply reliant on successful hunting, Zoologist seeking to study the beast\nC\nThe benefit of hunting the game is only granted if they are captured or killed in a very troublesome way, The animals are found around a different much more dangerous beast, The beasts have multiple life stages with different traits\nT\nTrove of beast pelts, Lure for the beasts, Map to their secret breeding grounds\nP\nRamshackle hunting camp, Altar to the beasts, Magical site where the beasts were first made\nRefugee Camp §\nThere’s a refugee camp in the area made up of people who’ve fled some calamity. It may be a bandit raid on their villages, an ethnic purge nearby, a religious schism they lost, the collapse of a functioning community, or some other disaster. The refugees have no better place to go or they’d have gone there by now; they’re probably dying off to local hazards at a greater or lesser rate, or trying to turn the camp into a functional settlement.\nE\nBrutal tyrant over the camp, Local marauder exploiting them, Horrible beast that hunts them\nF\nSympathetic young refugee, Local governmental representative who can’t help much, Earnest religious leader\nC\nThe refugees are highly undesirable to the surrounding polities, They’re demihuman or Blighted, The camp’s a hotbed of some not-too-quickly lethal but very contagious disease\nT\nVital cache of supplies, Precious possessions of the refugees, Relic they stole or rescued in their flight\nP\nMiserable camp of crude shanties, Damp refuge caverns, Ancient ruins made into a camp\nRampant Experiment §\nNot every Working or spell research is a success, and some effort here went drastically wrong. Some sort of rampantly overgrown flora or monstrously altered fauna roam the place, the result of magic gone awry. They probably have some quality or trait that was useful to the creator, but it was combined with so many drawbacks or dangers that the result is a menace.\nE\nMad sorcerer who caused it, Creature warped terribly by the experiment, Looter with no regard for the chaos their blundering is releasing\nF\nApologetic apprentice of the culprit, Non-hostile experimental victim, Local desperately fighting the experiments\nC\nAn outside power is promoting the disaster because it’s somehow to their advantage, The experiment results seem wholly beneficial at first, The experiment’s area of effect is slowly growing\nT\nCure or tool to halt the experiment, Precious object created by the experiment, Magical tool used in the experiment\nP\nSinister occult laboratory, Normal area terribly warped by the experiment, Local structure destroyed by the experiment\nRemnant Road §\nSome long-lost empire laid a road here, along with the waystations that once served to guard it. The surviving remnant may just be a short segment, or it might still lead to whatever destination of significance it once served. Other ruins of this empire are likely positioned along the road, and modern inhabitants might still make use of it as a highway through rough terrain, or have positioned their own settlements along its length.\nE\nAncient creature that guards the road from “bandits”, Bandit chief exploiting a ruined waypost, Local lord who collects cruel tolls\nF\nMerchant making use of the path, Local from a colony-village set up at one end, Remnant survivor from the culture that built it\nC\nThe road is magically useful or well-maintained, The road leads through some tremendously dangerous area, The road is built as a high and stepped structure that forms a tall defensive wall on one side\nT\nMagical pass allowing use of the road, Ancient weapon stored in a waypost, Key to unlocking a waypost’s vault\nP\nAncient watch station, Stretch of unnaturally perfect road, Monument to a forgotten king\nRemote Monastery §\nThere is a largely self-sustaining monastery, temple, hermitage, or other religious site in the area, one inhabited by clergy who have some particular need for isolation. They may be guardians of a holy site, imprisoned heretics, wardens of some refuge for travelers, or a particularly rigorous or heretical sect. They may be willing to provide services for strangers of acceptable character, and might well have problems that their limited resources can’t solve.\nE\nSinister-minded abbot, Demonic entity warring on the clerics, Cleric of a rival faith or sect determined to destroy them and all their allies\nF\nFriendly if unworldly local cleric, Native who trades with the monastery, Cleric who seriously reconsiders their choice to come here\nC\nThe monastery has been taken over by zealots or an outside power, The monastery is a cover for sinister occult doings, The place isn’t nearly as self-sufficient as it thought it would be\nT\nSacred relic of the place, Offering made by a grateful believer, Sacred text specific to their sect\nP\nWell-guarded fields outside the walls, Heavily-fortified monastic building, Hostel for travelers kept outside the monastery itself\nSavage Hamlet §\nThere’s a village in the area, but its inhabitants are vicious or profoundly unsociable in some way. They may deal violently with outsiders, have abhorrent cultural habits, be the decadent remains of some group cast out for their evil ways, or just Blighted of a kind that get along very poorly with baselines. The party should likely have some sort of indication of their nature given to them before the first contact, or else the village should be savage in ways that don’t necessarily lead to likely immediate attack.\nE\nBrutal village chieftain, Cruel shaman of a dark god, Non-local criminal who’s gone native in a bad way\nF\nRare better-dispositioned local, Missionary trying to civilize them, Local who sees profit in dealing with outsiders\nC\nThey are remarkably talented or learned at some activity, They appear harmless at first encounter, They have considerable virtues to go with their terrible vices\nT\nLocally-produced good of value, Loot from their victims, Tribute given by frightened neighbors\nP\nFighting pit for local entertainment, Chieftain’s barbaric hall, Ancient structure put to misuse\nRuined Fortification §\nThis place was of great strategic importance in some prior age, and a ruined castle, outpost, waystation, or military base can be found here. It may have been destroyed by the slow march of time, or some great military catastrophe may have shattered it. The site is probably too remote or now of too little military value to attract the interest of current governments, but it may still serve as an excellent lair for a more local tyrant or bandit lord.\nE\nFailed usurper “ruling” from this new seat, Zealous rebel chief marshaling strength here, Ghostly shade of the fortress’ last commander\nF\nNative forced to take refuge here, Remnant survivor of the original garrison, Government agent sent to investigate the site for usability\nC\nThe fortress was built to keep something in rather than out, Some political change has just made the site very valuable once more, The real bulk of the site is hidden from easy view\nT\nKey to open restricted areas of the site, Massive fixed weapon that still works, Precious trove guarded by the fortress\nP\nLong-broken gate, Wall slumped into a ramp, Tower snapped halfway up\nSculpted Terrain §\nIn a former age some tyrant or artist sculpted an entire landform here into a statue, monument, or artwork that is visible for miles. A carved mountainside, a molded hill, an intricate pattern of waterways, a mesa pierced with music-emitting tunnels, or some other huge artwork is obvious here, and probably can be seen from any point nearby. Such structures likely have some form of defense to prevent their vandalism, and may contain components that are very valuable in the present age.\nE\nPriest of a sculpture-worshiping cult, Berserk guardian of the art, Chief of a sculpture-dwelling remnant of the original creators\nF\nCourageous art-seeker, Artist desperately in search of inspiration, Treasure-hunter looking for the art’s loot\nC\nThe art is mobile or otherwise active somehow, The art has some very dangerous effect, The art is damaged and now causes an unintended consequence nearby\nT\nPrecious fragment of the art, Magical relic used by the art, Regalia of the former keeper of the art\nP\nViewing-site built for the art, Damaged or defaced area of the art, Pilgrim quarters meant for those coming to see the art\nSeductive Peril §\nThere’s a very appealing place, resource, or structure in the area that’s actually a dangerous snare for the unwary. Pools may be laced with slow poisons, bright flora might be carnivorous, valuable natural crystals might be radioactive, or ancient pleasure-pavilions might not let revelers go. Some natives might lurk near the peril to loot its victims, while others might intentionally drive prey into it.\nE\nMalevolent spirit of the peril, Cruel looter who uses the peril as a tool, Experimenter looking to exploit the peril\nF\nCompanion or friend of a victim, Clueless seeker of the peril’s treasure, Native who knows about the peril\nC\nDangerous as it is the peril does offer a very real reward, The peril is worshiped by locals, The danger is unintentional and related to the peril’s original function\nT\nLoot left by victims, Valuable component of the peril, Bait placed to lure victims\nP\nHidden charnel pit for victims, Enticingly charming facade, Now-abandoned camp of former prey\nToxic Ruins §\nThere’s a ruin in the area, but it’s poisonous or disease-infested. Such a blight may not be immediately obvious, with the effects slowly taking hold the longer an intruder remains. There’s probably something about the ruin that’s attractive to others, and the toxin isn’t quick enough to make plundering an obviously futile effort. In other cases, the toxin might be fast, but there could be some item or magic to resist it.\nE\nToxin-warped beast within, Sorcerer exploring the toxin’s potential, Cruel plunderer using expendable help to loot the site\nF\nNative who knows a cure for the toxin, Explorer trapped within the ruin, Native life form that’s immune to the toxin\nC\nThe toxin was a healthful atmosphere to the Outsider builder of the ruin, The toxin is radiation or some other invisible poison, The toxin is exuded by the substance or objects that are most valuable in the ruin\nT\nCure or protection from the poison, Incredibly toxic weapon or object, Damaged ancient relic that’s causing the toxic effect\nP\nEerily barren land around the ruin, Camp full of poisoned explorers, A grove of unnatural life amid the toxic stew\nTaboo Territory §\nPart of this area is strictly off-limits. It may be restricted to a particular holy priesthood, local rulers, the heirs of a particular lineage, or to everyone. The taboo may be the product of local religious beliefs, ruling edicts, or a practical realization that intruders keep stirring up perils that the locals have to deal with. Watchers likely keep guard over the area and may or may not speak up to warn off potential trespassers.\nE\nThe horrible thing within the territory, Bandit chief taking advantage of the taboo to hide there, Ancient guardian of the domain\nF\nExplorer lacking in caution, Accidental trespasser into the zone, Local who desperately needs something from inside the area\nC\nEntering the zone visibly marks trespassers for a time, A hostile force too strong for the warders is trying to get in or out, The taboo is rational but the reason the locals have is badly mistaken\nT\nTreasure unplundered within the zone, The precious relic the taboo is meant to guard, Valuable plant or animal that grows undisturbed within\nP\nAncient ruin untouched by intruders, Watchpost with a view of the site, Sealed gate to the zone\nTreacherous Terrain §\nA stretch of this area is naturally treacherous and dangerous in its terrain. It may be prone to sinkholes, mudslides, avalanches, quicksand, explosive flora, magical eruptions, boiling geysers, plunging crevasses, or falling stones. This terrain should block the path toward some interesting site or desired destination, or else the party likely has no reason not to simply turn around or go around it.\nE\nMalevolent nature-spirit of the place, Vile outcast who lairs amid the terrain, Monstrous beast native to the dangerous area\nF\nNative guide who knows a way through, Explorer fascinated by the terrain, Traveler forced to find a way through\nC\nThe perils manifest on a particular little-known schedule, The perils sometimes uncover lodes of valuable materials, The perils are an accidental legacy of an ancient malfunction\nT\nMap of the safe way through, Device to protect against the peril, Ancient treasure hidden within the peril\nP\nSmall safe zone inside the terrain, Ruined road or path amid the peril, Site of a camp destroyed by the peril\nTwisted Fauna §\nThe fauna in the area has been warped by some power, and is now dangerous to other forms of life. A lingering curse may have twisted the beasts, as might have ancient techno-sorcerous waste, Outsider manipulation, half-faded arratus, mad wizardry, religious cult manipulation, or ancient artistic goals. The beasts probably have some unifying characteristic or trait imbued by the process that warped them.\nE\nSavage beast-tamer, Hideously intelligent god-beast, The mad power that warped the beasts in the first place\nF\nNative trying to cope with the fauna, Hunter determined to bag one, Scholar trying to find the cause of the change\nC\nThe beasts are very useful or valuable in some way, The beasts were once humans, The beasts masquerade as normal animals\nT\nLoot of a victim of the beasts, The thing that changed them is a treasure itself, Trove coincidentally located in their territory\nP\nFetid lair of the beasts, Grove scarred by their activities, Tainted site that birthed them\nWorking Wreckage §\nA Working once was in the area, but has long since collapsed, decayed, or been destroyed by others. It’s at least building-sized, with some Workings being full-scale megastructures raised by ancient empires. While the Working’s original effect has long dissipated, pockets or fragments of it may still persist in the area, along with the automatons or servitor-people once charged with maintaining the site.\nE\nAnimated manifestation of the Working’s power, Sorcerer-looter gutting the wreck, Brutal chief of the natives mutated by its power\nF\nScholar dreaming of activating it once more, Treasure-hunter eager to pick its bones,Local from the surviving caretakers\nC\nIt would cause a regional catastrophe if re-activated, Even its remnant effects have large consequences, It was ruined when it was re-tuned to create a different effect\nT\nKey to controlling its remaining power, Spare part that’s now priceless, Valuable fragment of wreckage\nP\nAbandoned control room, Site of massive destruction from the Working’s collapse, Nest or lair built into the ruin\nUncanny Weather §\nThe area is affected by unnatural or magical weather conditions. It may be a pocket of snowy wasteland in a jungle, an area racked by cataclysmic storms, a shifted zone of space that overlaps with some alien world’s atmosphere, an area of perpetual balmy summer, or some other obvious anomaly. Natives may have figured out some way to exploit this condition, or it might be too dangerous for regular occupation.\nE\nRuthless sorcerer bent on unlocking its secrets, Monstrous beast that thrives in the environment, Dangerous remnant of the zone’s creators\nF\nNative who’s learned to live in the zone, Refugee trying to hide in it, Entrepreneur trying to profit by it\nC\nThe weather is controlled by a site or object, The change is very recent and is disrupting the locals, The weather leaves behind a valuable resource\nT\nAncient weather-control relic, Texts describing how to stop or control the weather, Abandoned loot from the original inhabitants of the area\nP\nWeather-blasted natural feature, Structure built to endure the weather, Relic building from before the weather happened\nZealot Colony §\nThere is a settlement of radical religious or ideological zealots here, ones too extreme to be tolerated in civilized lands. They may not necessarily be hostile, and they might have need of outside assistance, but their principles are likely to be bizarre or abhorrent to the PCs. Most such colonies are bent on creating new societies that may not actually be physically or psychologically possible for unaltered humanity.\nE\nCharismatic demagogue, Iron-fisted hereditary dictator, Dreamer willing to break any number of eggs for their theoretical omelet\nF\nLocal who quietly wants out, Reformer trying to temper things, Relative of a now-trapped member\nC\nThey’ve recently acquired an object or an alliance that gives them great power, The ostensible leader is just a puppet of the real and more pragmatic boss, They’re beginning to purity spiral into violent factions\nT\nDesperately-necessary supply cache, Wealth given up for the group, Product manufactured by near-slave members\nP\nGrand temple or ideological hall amid shanties, Mass public meeting, Prison for deviants"},"Workflow-&-Inspiration/Alexandrian/Design-a-Dungeon":{"title":"Design a Dungeon","links":["Workflow-&-Inspiration/Alexandrian/Running-a-Dungeon","Campaign-Status-Document","Workflow-&-Inspiration/Faction-System/Coterie-Faction-System"],"tags":[],"content":"What is needed:\n\nDungeon Map\nDungeon Key\n\nRecipe: 5 + 5 Dungeons §\nThis is an adventure recipe for a simple dungeon adventure. Just add the ingredients to the skeleton! This should be enough for a 4 hours session of play.\n1: Scenario Concept §\nStart a new empty note and follow this section: 1 Brainstorming.\nTo define the concept: Location, Denizens and Goal.\n2: Dungeon Features &amp; Corridor Themes §\nIn another blank note, put the keys of the dungeon, starting with General Dungeon Features and Corridor Themes.\n3: Five Featured Rooms §\nCreate five featured rooms:\n\n1 Challenge Room\n1 Fight Room\n1 Twist Room\n1 Reward Room\nAnother of Challenge, Fight, Twist or Reward room.\n\n4: Scenic Rooms §\nNow, create five scenic rooms. Follow Scenic Room.\n5: Mapping &amp; Keying §\nFollow 3 Mapping and 4 Keying.\nAdd navigational choices as well, like\n\nForks in corridors\nRooms with more than 1 exit\nSecret doors and passages\nCrossroads\n\n6: Finishing Touches §\n\nRevisit 2 Dungeon Features &amp; Corridor Themes\nClean up notes and add details as needed.\nDesign a Scenario Hook for PCs. Having everything defined, there should be plenty of inspiration to choose from.\n\nClassic hooks:\n\nA patron hires them to go to the dungeon and do something\nPCs found a treasure map or rumors talking about the dungeon\nPCs were attacked by someone from the dungeon\n\n\nCheck more hooks on page 498\n\n\n\nChallenge Room §\nThese are dilemmas, a tough choice between two options.\nDifferent types (roll 1d5):\nTrap §\nFollow Running Traps.\nEnvironmental §\nCan be a hazard like a trap, but also other challenge.\nThey evoke the dungeon location, making it influence the gameplay instead of only being scenery.\n\nBroken bridge over a chasm\nForce fields blocking a hallway\nDebilitating heat that exhausts over time unless measures are taken\nPolluted river that needs to be cleaned\nCliff to climb\nNeeding shelter during sudden blizzard\nSwimming across rapids filled river\nNavigating through an area of magical darkness\nA drawbridge that needs to be lowered to access the castle.\n\nSkill §\nThinking of a skill check-first challenge.\nIt’s important to give the player also a way to figure out the solution (OSR style) before doing the check.\n\n\n                   \n                  Tip \n                  \n                \nPresent a situation where the player needs to find a solution, THEN ask for the skill check.\nBonus points if the players can make their own solution or if they require multiple steps to resolve.\n\nPuzzle §\nShould always be optional, because they are fragile if players don’t have the correct insight.\nIf they are not blocking optional content, add alternatives to continue.\nDifferent types\n\nRiddle\nEncoded message\nSet of colored objects to manipulate in a certain way\nA maze\nLock with combination to be found\nEtc\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nIMO, could be interesting for in person play, less interesting online\n\nSocial §\nCan be an alternative to a Fight room as well, there is overlap.\nExamples\n\nBribing for info or service\nPersuading someone or some faction of a fact or to do something\nBeing asked to do something morally questionable as a shortcut to a solution\nInterrogation\nAdjudicating a feud between two NPCs\n\nFight Room §\nCheck Combat Encounter Design.\nDifferent types (roll 1d4 but should focus on the first 3)\nGuardian §\nProtecting something o someone, maybe just itself. Most classic.\nSentry §\nA sentry will attempt to raise the alarm somehow.\nCommon variant: a part fights, the rest raises the alarm.\nShould be kept a simpler encounter, since it can attract nearby rooms.\nThink about possible consequence if alarm is raised.\nMooks §\nShould be on the easy side to give a change of pace and making PCs be badasses. They can be reinforcements for a Sentry encounter as well.\nBoss §\nShould be hard. Should feature additional mooks as well for ablative shielding.\nTwist Room §\nComplication, surprise, inversion of expectations.\n(roll 1d5)\nTrick §\nAppears to be one thing, but it’s actually another.\nExamples:\n\nChained maiden is actually a medusa waiting to strike\nFake treasure as trap\nA collaborating servant is actually an important NPC\nIllusion\nIf the entire dungeon has some misdirection, this room is where they discover the truth.\n\nSecret Area §\nBonus area, shortcut to another place or for tactical advantage.\nRemix §\nTake on of the other rooms in the dungeon and twist it or invert it, letting the players use their experience with the other chamber.\nIf the other is a Scenic room, maybe here there is something hidden.\nIf it’s a challenge, an alternative solution is required.\nIf it’s a fight, terrain is different or variant enemies.\nEtc…\nCombo §\nTake two different room archetypes and combine them.\nBoss is a puzzle as well?\nOr fight encounter has a trap that is used by the enemies?\nEtc…\nUnexpected Ending §\nRevelation room where they think of having finished, but actually the solution is still missing. Can be a plot twist or simply a clue that the dungeon’s goal doesn’t end in this dungeon but in another adventure.\nReward Room §\nShould be mechanical and/or narrative.\n(roll 1d5)\nTreasure §\nItems, money, jewels, weapons, armors, rare books, trade goods, etc.\nHaving specific treasure can introduce logistic problems (how do you move the loot out of the dungeon? Need a clever solution). Liquidating a treasure can also be hooks for more adventures.\nClue §\nVital piece of information about another room or a different adventure.\nSanctuary §\nPlace of safety to rest and respite inside the dungeon. If used, might trigger a restocking or could be a fake sanctuary.\nBoon §\nThere is a benefit or advantage for PCs. Should be aligned to the dungeon theme.\nScenario Goal §\nHere is the goal of the dungeon. Often also a Combo Twist room, with a Boss or Guardian fight, a trap or similar.\nScenic Room §\nScenic rooms are not interactive and are useful to multiple things:\n\nReveal world or location lore\nForeshadowing of nearby featured room\nCool description to create atmosphere\nSome Trick (Tome of Adv Design)\n\nCan be split in 3 types:\nThemed Scenic Room §\nThey establish, develop or manipulate the themes of the dungeon. The themes are about the place, a character, concept, ideology, mood, composition.\nLook at the dungeon concept, how can this themed room reflect the location, denizens or goal?\n\n\n                   \n                  Example \n                  \n                \nFor a bandit camp with trained wolves, a themed room can be the empty kennels, foreshadowing the wolves in another featured room.\n\nUtility Scenic Room §\nThese are places that should logically exist given the concept of the dungeon.\nThey can be the backdrop of featured rooms, but can be scenic rooms as well.\n\n\n                   \n                  Example \n                  \n                \n\nA dwarven city should have forges.\nA bandit camp should have barracks for sleeping.\n\n\nFantastic Feature Scenic Room §\nUse the impossible and put it here.\n\n\n                   \n                  Example \n                  \n                \n\nA levitation sculpture formed from floating amethysts\nMagical painting that come to life\nTree with metallic leaves\nTaxidermied unicorn\nWaterfall of black acid\nRoom of magical portals leading to other rooms\nObservatory showing the sky of another place\nA shrine to unknown gods\n\n\nThey can also be non-fantastical, but still exotic and awe-inspiring. They are an opportunity to highlight your chosen genre.\n\nDungeon Types §\nMicro-dungeon §\nVery small, 1-2 featured rooms and 1-2 scenic rooms. Usually a total of 5 rooms.\nCan be easily incorporated in another adventure for a single scene almost.\nLarge Dungeons §\nUsually at least three times a 5 + 5 Dungeon. Requires multiple expeditions to explore, which changes the approach and pace of play.\nSome advices:\n\nNeeds different goal than “Clear the dungeon” to give strategic choice while exploring.\nXandered dungeon design.\nMix experiences in the dungeon. Use thematic areas to divide it and change pace, different encounter checks and random encounter tables if possible.\nMake the dungeon come to life with random encounters (or, to make it more dynamic, Adversary Rosters), restocking and updating the dungeon key while playing.\n\nThese and Mega Dungeons can be split in several levels. Maybe each level is its own 5 + 5 Dungeon?\nConnectors connect them vertically:\n\nStairs of various types (stright, spiral, helical etc)\nSlopes\nChutes\nLadders\nTrapdoors\nWindows\nTeleports\nTraps\nMulti-level chambers\nElevators\nBasket &amp; Pulleys\nRivers\nUnderwater\nCollapsed passages\n\nMega dungeons §\nBigger than a Large Dungeon, has enough content for a full campaign. Contains multiple scenarios, like multiple goals and/or multiple factions. Factions control chunks of the dungeon and give unique challenges.\nStarting a Megadungeon §\nPrepping the first 3 levels should be enough, then after the first session, check how many rooms were explored and use that as an estimate for where they could reach next time at the worst case scenario.\nIn case you want to make a basic plan of the entire megadungeon, a solution might be to list the major factions in each level to have inspiration for faction relations.\nJaquaysed dungeons §\nAka non-linear structure of dungeons.\nUseful techniques:\n\nLoops!\n\nAdd landmarks to provide indications to players.\n\n\nMultiple entrances\nMultiple level connections\nDiscontinuous level connections\n\nConnections skipping levels. Useful also when returning and skipping ahead to lower levels.\n\n\nSecret &amp; unusual paths\nSub-Levels\n\nSmaller section of a level\n\n\nDivided levels\n\nLevel is split in multiple parts disconnected from each other. Need to go to other levels to reach.\n\n\nMinor elevation shifts\nMidpoint entry (of vertical levels)\n\n\nGeneral procedure:\n1: Brainstorming §\nTo define:\n\nScenario concept, formed by:\n\nLocation\nDenizens\n\nCan be decided from a monster list as well\nPick two types of denizens and mix them\n\nWhy are they together?\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\nMaybe a MacGuffin?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s good to start from one of the three elements and go from there.\nPossible locations examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1d20Location type1Cave2Ruins3Castle’s oubliette4Subterranean city5Crypt or catacombs6Mine7Mansion8Pyramid9Tower10Ship or shipwreck11Colossal body12City building or businness13Security vault14Stronghold or fortress15Cliff dwellings16Treetop buildings17Subacquatic complex18Pocket dimension19Cloud cities20Prison\n2: List rooms &amp; scenes ideas §\nBased on the concept, make a list of cool location, needed locations for the general location to make sense and also possible cool scenes or obstacles that can be present.\nA bullet list with a short phrase for each is enough for now.\nNo need to list them all, new ideas will come as well.\nQuestions to answer: §\n\nWhat challenges need to be overcome to achieve the goal?\nWhat logically needs to exist in this location?\nWhat cool things can the denizens do, and what environments would make that even more fun?\nWhat are some common features of a location like this? (Castle → Throne room)\nWhat fantastical twist could you apply to common rooms?\nHow might the special abilities of NPCs create unique needs or alter the functions of common rooms?\n\nSome of these elements can be merged together to have something better!\n3: Mapping §\nMake a rough graph of how rooms are connected together.\nNew ideas coming up should be added to the rooms list.\nAfter some iterations on it, you will have a good graph, which can be converted to a detailed map.\nWhile making the detailed map, number the rooms.\nIf having multiple levels, vertical connections like stairs should have labels indicating the room key they connect to in the destination level, for ease of use.\nIf making a map with Dungeon Alchemist, I can put the exported image in Excalidraw and add numbers on it there.\n4: Keying §\nGeneral Dungeon Features §\nAt the beginning, decide about common things to all or most rooms and make a description.\nFor big or mega dungeons, these could change by level or by other type of cluster of rooms.\nUsual stuff in a brief bullet-point list:\n\nIllumination\nCeiling height\nWalls\nDoors\n\nCorridor Themes §\nSame as for General Dungeon Features section.\nHaving a few general elements that can be present and decide randomly what each corridor has is a good idea.\nRoom Keys §\nFor each room:\n\nName: Quick remainder of content and purpose\nBoxed Text: Initial description of room, follow Exits &amp; Dimensions.\nReactive Skill Checks: Descriptions in response to likely skill checks\nRoom Elements: Detailed description of the room content.\nType: Featured or Scenic? (Reminder for me to have a good balance during design)\n\nFeatured rooms are where most of the action and interaction is. They can be of different types, like in 3 Five Featured Rooms.\nAdd at least 3 interactive elements to each featured room. It’s important to have each PC do something during the same Dungeon Turn.\nRules to make Awesome Descriptions §\nThree of Five §\nOf the five senses, include three of them in the description.\nTwo Cool Details §\nAdd a couple of irrelevant but cool details in descriptions.\nMight be useful to players, but they are especially useful in creating atmosphere.\nThree-by-Three §\nEach of the three interactive elements in featured rooms should have three description details.\n\n\n                   \n                  Example \n                  \n                \nOne interactive element:\nA bookshelf → A tall bookshelf in the corner, its shelves crammed with scrolls and books.\n\nExits &amp; Dimensions §\nAt the beginning of entering a room, prioritize this order of descriptions:\n\nSize and shape of the room\n\nCan be precise (20x30 ft) or general (“Large chamber, “small oval room&quot;&quot;)\nDon’t forget height!\n\n\nExits from the room.\nDescribe the room. Use Rules to make Awesome Descriptions for help.\nDescribe the Room Elements with Three of Five and Three-by-Three\n\n5: Combat Encounter Design §\nAfter keying rooms, you will have some monsters/NPCs.\n\nCheck their abilities/stat block. What terrain feature can be useful to those abilities?\nThen, try to have different monsters for variety. Also variants of the same monster as well.\n\nRandom Encounter Table §\nTime to also fill a random encounter table.\nChoose a size. 2d6 is a general good rule, with more common elements in the middle.\nThe encounters can be bespoke or procedural, but both types should be either easy or medium encounters, because they could be combined with nearby encounters.\nCheck also Adversary Rosters if you want more control of dynamic groups of denizens doing specific stuff.\nAlso Dungeon Factions to have factions politics involved.\nBespoke Encounters §\nAka prepped encounter. They are specific creatures doing specific, predesigned things. A setpiece.\n\n\n                   \n                  Example \n                  \n                \n5 orcs are heading to the archery range, boasting about how well they will shoot. Two goblins bring their equipment. The group make opposing perception and stealth checks against PCs to see who sees what.\n\nProcedurally Generated Encounters §\nThey are kernels for situations, to be improvised on the spot based on local situation and inspiration. The Reaction check and Distance Check can help in giving inspiration.\nThere can be also a specific NPC in the random table, no need to limit to generic creatures.\n\n\n                   \n                  Idea \n                  \n                \nMy idea: To help with on-the-fly improv, together with the creatures, each row could have pre-rolled oracles on Why they are there, Where they are going, Where they come from (which area of the dungeon or outside).\n\nSteps to build it:\n\nChoose or roll 1 or more creature types\nHow many for an easy or medium encounter?\nDice range to randomize exact quantities\n\nOne of the rows could be “Roll again twice” to have combined encounters.\nWhere do they come from? §\n\nOption 1: Remove them from around the Dungeon Key\nOption 2: Have a pool of wandering monsters from which to get them. A pool for each type of creature.\nOption 3: Not tracked at all, random encounters always available.\nI prefer either 2 or 3. 2 is good for smaller dungeons.\n\nOn-the-Fly Encounters (for Solo) §\nExample of Encounters for on-the-fly exploration, like in Ironsworn Delve.\nFrom https://chaoclypse.substack.com/p/soloing-dungeons-the-osr-way\nEncounter List (d10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1d10Result1-45-67-8910Random EncounterOn rolling a 10, roll for a random encounter based on the dungeon level you are on.\nOn rolling on an empty entry, roll for a random encounter or generate a creature and fill it in.\nYou may notice that the encounter list is staggered in terms of probability. This makes it so that there is a “dominant” faction on each dungeon level. Feel free to adjust this, or make the chances equal.\nThis way, over time you will get more familiar with what lives in the dungeon — factions naturally emerge. However, you can still be completely taken off guard, especially when you roll a 10!\nRestocking §\nIn smaller or regular dungeons (like 5+5 Dungeons), you will probably need a new scenario concept as well.\nIn bigger dungeons, restocking can also be part of its story, that now is influenced by the PCs’ previous actions. Since they are making multiple expeditions, the situation will evolve accordingly.\nIn mega dungeons restocking is part of the evolving narrative.\nProcedure §\n\nDivide the dungeon in zones. They can be:\n\nA single 5+5 Dungeon segment (if they are the dungeon building blocks)\nA level (can be further divided in smaller zones)\nChokepoints\nLairs of factions, which would logically still attract other factions for some logistical or military reason\n\n\nMake a Restocking Check (1 on 1d8) (doable also during long rests inside the dungeon) by choosing the zones to test. They can be:\n\nEmpty/Cleared Zones\nDisrupted Zones: Where PCs passed through.\nEverything: Doesn’t make sense to reroll prepped and not used stuff. Do not use.\n\n\nIf 1, either do a Custom Restock or a Procedural Restock.\n\nCustom Restock: Based on the story so far, develop what the affected factions and creatures will do and restock based on that. For example, they could ask help to other levels/factions/outside. This will prompt you to also make new factions as well, helping worldbuilding.\nProcedural Restock:\n\nRoll on a Stocking Table (like a random encounter table) to determine which creatures are coming. (The random encounter table can be reused as well)\nAdd minor treasure to the zone, carried by the new denizens. On a 1 on 1d8, add a major treasure as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the dungeon key §\nUsually done while restocking.\nWhile playing, note main actions that affect a room made by the PCs.\nAfter the session, if there are enough changes, make a Scenario Update, a new note working like a diff file.\nIt’s a list of changes that were made by PCs. Keep it simple and minimal, updating the original Room Key entry to reflect those changes.\nWhen accumulating these Updates, creating a new Campaign Status Document.\nAnother approach is to create a new Dungeon Key increment version, in case the diff has become too big. Just copy the old one and update where needed.\n\n\n                   \n                  Idea \n                  \n                \nI would personally have a small section under each room key for the small updates. If the changes are too much, just copy that individual room keys that are too big and update the description, to avoid having to do a big chunk of work.\n\nDynamic Dungeons §\nAdditional techniques to have dungeons respond to PCs’ actions.\nAdversary Rosters §\nA tool to detach NPCs and monsters from rooms and having them doing things around.\nUseful mainly in regular and smaller dungeons, for bigger ones, random encounters are good enough and easier to keep track of.\nThe Roster is a list of denizens separate from the room key, where they don’t appear.\n\n\n                   \n                  Example \n                  \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction GroupAreaNotes4 mud mephitsArea 12 soke mephits + 1 steam mephitArea 2Work Crew: 2 magmin + 2 mud mephitsArea 8Moving between A8 &amp; A10Steampowered ConstructArea 10needs to be fully chargedThe denizens can be busy with patrols, working between 2 points, going from A to B, etc…\n\nThe basic chunk is the Action Group to group together denizens that do something together. At the start, you can have more AG in the same spot, before splitting doing their thing.\nThey should also have stat blocks if needed, for quick reference. Still ticking time, but no Random Encounter checks.\nAction Group Types §\nPatrols §\nMake a looping circuit through a location. Can be useful to have a separate note for Patrols if there are many, with the route signed.\nMobile §\nDefault group. Keyed to a location but can respond to external stimuli.\nMostly Stationary §\nUnlikely to leave the area. Could be a choice or not. If they could become Mobile, they should be an AG. Signal them in the Roster to quickly ignore them, like indenting the entry.\nStationary §\nWill never leave the location they are in. Not included in the roster, but in the room key instead.\nAdvanced Rosters §\nVariable Areas §\nSome AGs could move between areas instead or remaining in the specific group of rooms.\nOn the Roster list them.\n\n\n                   \n                  Example \n                  \n                \nFew examples\n\nArea 21 or Area 40.\nArea 21 (1-2), Area 40 (4-6) on 1d6\nArea 21 (day), Area 40 (night)\n\n\nDo not go too granular, details should come from play.\nNotes/Footnotes §\nAdding notes to the AGs is useful for adding specific details to the AG, have tactical notes, if Mostly Stationary, why? and other things to keep in mind or to speed up generation (Names?)\nMultiple Rosters §\nCould be useful in case of particular scenarios. Day Roster and Night Roster? Normal status and Alert status?\nOnly useful if there is a big change for some reason, otherwise having small conditionals in individual AGs is enough.\nSplit Rosters §\nFor large dungeons, having multiple Rosters simplifies management. One Roster per level, for a megadungeon for example, or some special role for AGs, like VIPs or active response teams.\nRosters &amp; Random Encounters §\nUsually one or the other. Rosters for smaller locations, REs for bigger ones.\nHybrid approach is possible by continue checking for REs while playing.\nOne example is in a megadungeon, a Roster for each level, but RE checks for eventual denizens of other levels passing through.\nAnother example is to randomize Patrols and keep the other more passive types as AGs.\nRoster Restocking §\nRestocking is faster, just create a new one for the disturbed areas. Minimal updates needed to room keys in this case, usually.\nPassive Locations §\nRosters are useful for active dungeons. A dusty tomb undisturbed for centuries might not require one, for example.\nDynamic Encounter Design §\nWith dynamic dungeons, you need a dynamic way to design encounters.\nHaving encounters be combined is common with Actions Groups moving around, so you want to keep each AG a easy encounter alone, since the difficulty goes up if multiple AGs are encountered together.\nPrinciples of Dynamic Encounter Design §\n\nAvoid single boss encounters, difficult to balance and tactically uninteresting.\nSingle AG encounters still provide some resource ablation even if easy.\nTwo or three AGs should be a challenging encounter.\nFour or more AGs should still be winnable, but should be very heavy on resources or require clever thinking. (rare occurrence and usually AGs join during battle, not all together)\nFor narrative systems, these principles are less useful imho.\nAt world level, you can have a summary of the faction (if present outside the dungeon) using Coterie Faction System.\n\nDungeon Factions §\nIf a dungeon is completely controlled by a single faction, it’s a Lair.\nInstead, more factions can be competing in the dungeon. They give also opportunities to PCs and to disrupt the current status quo.\nDuring restocking, faction dynamics can be updated to reflect current happenings.\nCreating Factions §\nYou will need:\n\nFaction roster\nFaction territory\nFaction agenda\nFaction reaction\n\nFaction Roster §\nIt’s the Adversary Roster of the area controlled by this faction, with notes about alliances etc.\nFaction Territory §\nThe area controlled. Can be useful to color code rooms belonging to the same faction to better visualize.\nThere can also be unclaimed areas as well, actually it’s logic between factions.\nFaction Agenda §\nWhat do they want to achieve?\nFaction Reaction §\nCan be the default Reaction table or personalized, based on previous encounters with PCs or simple predisposition.\nRandom Faction Conflict §\nWhat are the relations between factions? If uninspired, roll them.\nMake a Random Faction Table, listing the factions and assign a die.\nAdd three entries:\n\nWandering Adventurers: represents other competing groups.\nOutsiders: it’s a prompt for factions outside of the dungeon, like another nearby location.\nRoll Again Twice: for multi-faction conflicts.\n\nNow follow this procedure:\n\nFaction Conflict Check: roll 1d6. 1 = conflict has broken out.\nRoll twice on the faction table. If same faction, could it be internal conflict?\nRoll on Faction Conflict Table to determine outcome\n\n\n[!Faction Conflict Table]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1d8Outcome1Stalemate Skirmish21 Faction Damaged31 Faction Crippled41 Faction Destroyed5Both Factions Damaged6Both Factions Crippled7Both Factions Destroyed8Factions Unite\n\nStalemate Skirmish: Largerly unaffectd, maybe minor losses or reinforced defenses.\nDamaged: Losses of around 25%.

Why?\nSomeone murdered? Something stolen or destroyed?\n\n\n                   \n                  From Unchained Mysteries \n                  \n                \nThis is the Step 1 The Spark\n\nStep 2: The Hook §\nHow are the PCs involved?\nWitnesses? Formally invited?\nStumble upon a crime scene?\nSomeone involves them?\n\n\n                   \n                  From Unchained Mysteries \n                  \n                \nThis is the Beginning\n\nStep 3: The Ending §\nWhat’s the conclusion?\nWhere do they learn the final answer and/or the final big fight with the BBEG?\nThis is the last scene of the scenario/adventure.\n\n\n                   \n                  From Unchained Mysteries \n                  \n                \nThis is the Ending\n\nStep 4: Nodes §\n\nBrainstorm cool locations and people related to the mystery.\nAim for 3 Investigation scenes + Hook scene + Ending scene to have a 5 Node Mystery. Usually good for a single session of play.\nBrainstorm more than 3 Investigation scenes, then pick the best 3. Can the leftover be merged into the best 3 to make them better?\nIf you plan on having social only scenes (talking with a single NPCs only), count them as half scene for the 5 scene quota. They are usually shorter.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  From Unchained Mysteries \n                  \n                \nThis is the Middle\n\nStep 5: Proactive Element §\nIt’s a bonus scene that can be triggered at any time and reaches the PCs proactively.\n\nUseful to bring the investigation back on track\nOr, add more content if PCs are going too fast\n\nTwo main options:\n\nThe bad guy discovers being investigated by PCs and tries to block/kill them\nThe next step of the bad guy plan happens (and PCs learn of it)\n\nThese proactive scenes should have multiple leads and clues inside, so they can be useful regardless of the point where the PCs are in the mystery graph.\n\n\n                   \n                  From Unchained Mysteries \n                  \n                \nThis is SIMILAR to the Tripwires\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Adding Dungeons, Heists or Raids \n                  \n                \nA location of the mystery might be a Micro-dungeon. Multiple scenes happen there, with the three clues for 1 or more conclusions found in different rooms.\nSame can be done with Raids or Heists\n\nStep 6: Connect them with clues §\nWe need to connect the 5 scenes together like in a Conclusion type structure.\nIn each scene, add 3 clues pointing to the other.\nA Revelation List is useful to get started. Use Making Clues for inspiration.\n\nList each investigation scene\nFor each scene, list the 3+ clues that are needed to reach the same conclusions.\n\nMy experience §\nAfter trying building one mystery, I think starting with a list of revelations/conclusions (not a Revelation List) that compose the mystery and the Spark Event (Unchained Mysteries vocabulary), make a Clue List, listing all scenes and sprinkling clues for each revelation there.\nThis also negates the need for a Revelation List, but maybe it can be useful to build one to check while running.\nStep 7: Ancillary Revelations §\nThere are some conclusions that are not strictly needed for the investigations and will not lead to new scenes. They can still give an advantage to PCs, like preparing themselves better to a future situation.\nThese are also smaller, side enigmas that give more flesh to the world.\nStep 8: Flesh out your Scenes §\nLook at the defined scenes and add detail.\nIf the scene is a location, not different from a dungeon key description.\nThey don’t need to be single locations. Might be a group of locations together (example: a bar with the manager’s office on the back) or an entire dungeon.\n\nDescriptions of the location or the NPC\nImportant elements (clues)\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Prepping Scenes vs Running Scenes \n                  \n                \nKeep elements of the scene you prep as a toybox of tools you need for that scene, but do not script how they are used. PCs can approach a scene in many different ways, so keep it loose, a bit like LazyDM.\n\n\n\n                   \n                  Like in Lazy DM \n                  \n                \nSome parallels with Lazy DM. You would prep for each scene a series of clues (Secrets and Clues step of Lazy DM) and a list of potential scene (Potential Scenes and/or Define Monsters steps of Lazy DM)\n\nStep 9: Running the Mystery §\nYou can use the Revelation List as a checklist, to be crossed out when the PCs reach a conclusion and tracking all found clues.\nIf a conclusion is at risk because the PCs haven’t found most of the clues, you will see it immediately and keep an eye on the last clue. (my addition: just remove any DC or barrier to finding it, so it’s guaranteed that the last one is found. Changing a bit the clue to fix it, like OSR does to skip checks if PCs think abut doing the right investigation approach but are unlucky.)\n5 x 5 Campaign §\nTo have different scenarios\nStep 1: Design five 5 Node Mysteries §\nCreate them independently, ideas will come naturally on how to connect them.\nStep 2: Connect each Scenario as a Node §\nArrange the five Basic 5 Node Mysteries into a Conclusions pattern.\nThe clues to other Mysteries should be scattered throughout the whole Mystery currently played. Can be a reward to finish it, can be during investigation, can be in the hook.\nPCs might not finish a mystery while starting another, it’s fine. They will get back to it.\nFor a D&amp;D campaign, a 5x5 Campaign should be ideal for a whole Tier of play.\nIt would technically be a Funnels with 4 Conclusions inside.\nExpanding it §\nInstead of using Conclusions patterns, you can insert other things or go with a Node Cloud without a clear structure.\nAlso different types of scenarios can work as well.\nNode types §\n\n\n                   \n                  Node definition \n                  \n                \nSomething from which a clue can be gathered.\n\nThese are Conclusions that PCs need to reach. Either as Leads to a location or as a clue to a different type.\nEach Node/scenario can be:\n\nLocations\n\nGives clues by being explored.\n\n\nPerson\n\nGives clues by observing them or questioning them.\n\n\nOrganizations (also People + Locations)\n\nGives clues about other nodes usually, similar to People, but in more indirect ways. Can be official or unofficial.\n\n\nEvents\n\nSomething that happens at a specific time and usually a specific place. Can be something to prevent happening or something to attend.\n\n\nActivities\n\nSomething the PCs are supposed to do in order to gain 1+ clues.\n\n\nThing (my addition)\n\nSomething useful or needed. Usually included in Activities, Events or Dungeon/Heist/Raids nodes.\n\n\nAny of Dungeon/Heist/Raid scenarios (Fractal nodes)\nProactive\n\nThey come to the PCs.\nUseful as backup to give more clues\nReactions to PCs actions, from People or Organizations.\nThey can be Events if they are aimed at the PCs specifically.\n\n\n\nNon-linear node structures §\nConclusions §\n\n1 Hook scene + 3 (or more) Investigation scene + 1 Conclusion scene. Ideal for 5 Scene Mysteries while keeping them flexible. You can have more than 3 Investigation scenes!\nFunnels §\n\nA series of Conclusions with chokepoints to control the flow (and guaranteeing that some conclusions are reached).\nEach layer is a free-form investigation sandbox that leads forward gently.\nIdeal for classic D&amp;D campaigns, where each layer is for a Tier of play, avoiding PCs skipping to too-high CR enemies.\nPCs will unlikely go back to before the\nLayer Cakes §\n\nSimilar to Funnels, but more gentle in driving forward the story.\nEach node in Layer X has a clue to other nodes on Layer X and ONE clue to Layer X+1.\nExploring completely Layer X will give 1 clue for each node in Layer X+1, satisfying the Inverted Three Clue Rule.\nPCs will probably go back and forth the layers.\nLoops §\n\nAll nodes have clues pointing to each other.\nIdeal to have multiple entrances (i.e. Hooks). Maybe scattered around different places in a hexcrawl?\nDead Ends §\n\nE here is a dead end. Has no clues inside of him, but can be useful as optional, bonus content that can give an edge later on. Extra treasure? Tactical info?\nThe leads pointing to E are bonus clues and don’t count for the 3 clues quota.\nE doesn’t need to have clues, but it might. They still remain extra though.\nNode Cloud §\nWith time, instead of structuring things like before, you will end up with nodes without a structure, but following both rules. This is fine, leaving the PCs with a sandbox to navigate.\nLike a region with different ruins to explore, each has clues pointing to the others, but no order is enforced for each of them.\nHow to organize nodes for play §\nNo need to draw nodes and connections. Use the following:\nClue List §\nA Clue List is a list of all the clues inside a node.\nUseful while prepping the scenario.\nExample for a Werewolf killer scenario Clue List: §\n\n\n                   \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nFrom https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule.\nClue list generated by me based on random scenes.\n\n\nScene 1: Crime Scene\n\nOver-sized claw marks on the victims (He’s a Werewolf)\nPictures of the same guy on a victim (He’s a former lover)\nA broken crate reading DANNER’S MEATS at one of the crime scenes (Check out the Butcher Shop)\n\n\nScene 2: Home of Victim 1\n\nTracks that turn from wolf paw prints to human footprints (He’s a Werewolf)\nLove letters written by the same guy (He’s a former lover)\nPictures of the same guy kept in their houses somewhere (He’s a former lover)\nA note saying “meet me at the butcher shop” crumpled up and thrown in a wastepaper basket (Check out the Butcher Shop)\n\n\nScene 3: Home of Victim 2\n\nOne of the victims owned a handgun loaded with silver bullets (He’s a Werewolf)\nPictures of the same guy kept in their houses somewhere (He’s a former lover)\nA jotted entry saying “meet P at butcher shop” in the day planner of one of the victims (Check out the Butcher Shop)\n\n\n\nRevelation List §\nA Revelation List is a list of clues that point to the node. Inverse of a Clue list.\nUseful while running the scenario.\nTo make one:\n\nList each node\nFor each node, list the 3+ clues that are needed to reach the same conclusions.\n\nExample for a Werewolf killer scenario Revelation List: §\n\n\n                   \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nFrom https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule.\nScene linking done by me with random Scenes names.\n\nFor each of these conclusions (he’s a werewolf; he’s a former lover; we should check out the butcher shop) we’ll need three clues.\n\nHE’S A WEREWOLF:\n\nTracks that turn from wolf paw prints to human footprints. (Scene 2: Home of victim 1)\nOver-sized claw marks on the victims. (Scene 1: Crime Scene)\nOne of the victims owned a handgun loaded with silver bullets. (Scene 2: Home of victim 1)\n\n\nHE’S A FORMER LOVER:\n\nLove letters written by the same guy. (Scene 2: Home of victim 1)\nA diary written by one victim describing how he cheated on her with another victim. (Scene 3: Home of victim 2)\nPictures of the same guy either on the victims or kept in their houses somewhere. (Scene 3: Home of victim 2) AND (Scene 2: Home of victim 1) AND (Scene 1: Crime Scene) (This counts as 3 clues)\n\n\nCHECK OUT THE BUTCHER SHOP:\n\nA broken crate reading DANNER’S MEATS at one of the crime scenes. (Scene 1: Crime Scene)\nA note saying “meet me at the butcher shop” crumpled up and thrown in a wastepaper basket. (Scene 2: Home of victim 1)\nA jotted entry saying “meet P at butcher shop” in the day planner of one of the victims. (Scene 3: Home of victim 2)\n\n\n\nMaking Clues §\nSome broad categories for clues, for inspiration: §\n\nPhysical Artefacts\nGlyphs/Data\nBiosignature\nInterrogation\nSurveillance\n\nSome examples from these:\n\nCorrespondence (letters, emails, etc.)\nDiaries\nEphemera from a location (matchbook, theatrical posters, tickets)\nOfficial reports\nTracks (to be followed)\nTrailing someone\nBusinness cards\nFingerprints\nDNA\nBlood type (and fantastical ones)\nGraffiti\nFinancial records\nTattoos\nCanvassing (going door to door to start interactions)\nVideo/Audio recording\nMystic visions/dreams\nShipping info\nBooks &amp; bookmarks\nBackground checks/ Bureaucratic records\n\nClues to the same conclusion should be of different type, to avoid repetition.\nAnother way to keep them varied, is to look at the skill list of the PCs and choose different ones needed for each clue §\nThird way, work from the conclusion of the Revelation List and generate clues based on what you need to include inside. §\nLike, I need a clue that points to X, Y and Z. You make 1 clue for each in this scene. You also make sure that all clues are actually present."},"Workflow-&-Inspiration/Alexandrian/Running-a-Dungeon":{"title":"Running a Dungeon","links":["Workflow-&-Inspiration/Alexandrian/Dungeon-Running-Sheet.pdf","Toolbox/2D-Reaction-Table.png"],"tags":[],"content":"The Dungeon Turn §\n\nMark ticks (to track resources, time, etc…)\nMake an Encounter Check\nDeclare actions\nMake Perception-type checks as necessary\nResolve Actions, including tracking movement on the map.\n\nUsually a turn lasts around 10 minutes of in game time, but needs to be taken not too precisely, same with distances.\nThis procedure works best if kept hidden to players, since it leads to more fluid play.\nUse this Dungeon Running Sheet to keep track of everything (make a copy) Dungeon Running Sheet.pdf\nTicks §\nUse the tracker to tick each turn.

New situations sheets can be developed as needed.\nWhen prepping a situation, build the following components:\n\nThe location. Where is this situation taking place? Often it’s a big location like a castle, a manor, a bunch of caves, a lair, or a dungeon. We ensure the location has multiple ways in and multiple ways to move throughout it.\nThe inhabitants. Who resides at the location? These residents might be guards, villagers, cultists, or whoever populates the location. Some denizens might be powerful and hostile. Some locals might just be the serving staff or non-combatant villagers. Some areas of the location might have intelligent and organized creatures while others have nasty monsters or ravenous undead. This presents a good mix of options the characters can choose from when dealing with the inhabitants. Few adventurers try to negotiate with an otyugh.\nBehaviors. What are the inhabitants actually doing here? What patterns do they follow? What would they be doing if the characters weren’t here? Knowing what their normal behavior is will help us determine what happens when the characters start doing things.\nThe goal. Why would the characters come here? What do they want? Are they trying to steal something? Recover something? Save someone? Stop a ritual? Give the characters a reason to come to that location and set measures for success other than killing everything.\nPotential complications. What complications might take place? Is someone big and powerful returning soon? Is another group trying to steal the same thing? What might shake things up in the middle? These complications help shift the course of the situation as it plays out in ways no one can predict.\n\nOnce we’ve planned this situation, let the characters learn about location and inhabitants, and allow the characters to reinforce their goal. Then, during the session, we let the players choose their characters’ approach and enjoy the outcome.\nPersonal note §\nIt can be similar to BitD structure, with scores that happen in a place where a situation is setup. This structure reinforces the “Play to find out” approach.\nGreat to also organize the locations in different zones, like an Hitman level with different rules.\nL.O.G. approach §\nFrom ICRPG.\nCan be prepped by themes and rolled on as necessity, like Pirate L.O.G..\nWWN fractal adventure seeds approach §\nUsing the fractal adventure seeds, together with WWN tags (or SWM, CWN), can give you great seeds and situations\nDungeon Adventures §\nMainly follow Tome of Adv Design workflow.\nCan also use Alexandrian’s Design a Dungeon in alternative.\nCan be useful to use The Adventure Crafter for the initial seed.\nCan also use Dungeons &amp; Dilemmas to create a storied dungeon and how it influences nearby spaces.\nFast dungeon creation workflow: §\n\nFirst Pass:\n\nDecide on high level overview of dungeon. (Dungeon &amp; Dilemmas provides fast tables for this)\n\nWho built it?\nOriginal need fulfilled?\nIf ruined, cause of ruin?\nWho are the current factions inside?\nWhich interactions with outside? Simply being known still counts.\n\n\nMake a small list of needed locations and NPCs\nMake a quick pointcrawl of various places, no need to think in detail. Use Excalidraw.\n\nYou can use Cyclic based design for a quick first draft.\n\n\n\n\nSecond Pass:\n\nIdentify clusters of nodes. Give a common theme to each. Can be environmental or faction or whatever.\nModify node connections as needed, add a description of what’s in each node.\n\n\nThird Pass:\n\nPopulate each node/room.\n\nEmpty rooms can be useful for exposition and clues.\n\n\nGenerate traps if needed (Prepless GM has some useful tables to generate them)\n\nWho placed them?\nWhat are they protecting?\nAlways foreshadow them.\n\n\nPlace monsters (Consider motivations etc like in Dungeon &amp; Dilemmas)\n\nGenerate Component based ones for puzzle-like combats\n\n\n\n\nFourth Pass:\n\nConsider making a detailed map in Dungeon Draft or 3D Canvas. Maybe only of important rooms.\n\n\n\nAdditional resources §\nAll the xWN books by Crawford.

Complex items have 1-6 condition points. Using my rundown ship as an example, I list a bunch of systems and assign total cond points. But also for a room I go more micro, like an airlock, and assign systems for that with cond too. Anything that you have to interact with to perform a function. So for the airlock I have two doors, activation terminals inside and out of the airlock. The pumps (which I say is outside the space craft). I then make a “reliability” for each cond point (on the fly as needed for a system). Failed cond points are broken and I roll an effect on a random table that gets triggered if you use the system. Its a d66 table where the first roll is the type of system: electrical, mechanical, chemical, software, and void (a DiS thing for sort of weird cosmic horror type things). I call that a “degradation”. So a computer terminal might have 2 cond. And if I use it I might find out one cond is broken and has a degradation. I find out its electrical and it randomly shocks its user if they touch it. I also add random failures on use. Another “reliability check”. On fail, another cond breaks and has a degradation. But also on these failures you roll on a different table of acute failures. So if you activate a manual release in the airlock door you might get a failure, mechanical, something internal snaps and breaks when you try the door. The manual release is no longer an option until the cond point is repaired.\n\n\n\n\n\nNPCs §\nBackstory using The Adventure Crafter.\nAppearance, motivations etc from expectations and Meaning Tables of General Flow.\nOther tools:\n\nfolder 000.Toolbox\\NPC Creation &amp; Emulation\nSUM\n\nFactions §\nCourts from WWN can be a good way to also simulate them.\nUse Coterie Faction System.\nUse News Feed Place and Character Feeds from MM35, in addition to Coterie Faction System.\nFaction Workflow §\nCoterie Faction System for general narrative Context and News Feeds\nCan use https://icastlight.blogspot.com/2022/01/grendel-mendel-using-punnett-squares.html to design monsters in factions.

The investigators dig to unveil it.\nThis leads to have a backstory of the NPCs involved, giving a good context for the DM to remain flexible during play and easily prep sessions.\nStep 1: The Spark §\nFirst Step, the Spark:\n\nDefine a transgression (can be monetary, physical or moral/social). Someone did something that they want to keep secret. Someone else has lost something from this event.\n\nWe have our first 2 NPCs and a connection.\n\n\nFrom there, expand to other NPCs connected to the first 2 in any way. All are impacted more or less, good or bad. Respond to these questions:\n\nHow do they experience this impact?\nWhat do they intend to do about it?\n\n\nCan be fractal as needed, but having 4-8 NPCs total should describe a dynamic situation.\n\nFinal result at this point: A list of NPCs and an ongoing situation.\nIt’s already playable by the GM.\nTHIS IS ALREADY ENOUGH FOR SIMPLER ADVENTURES.\nStep 2: The Timeline §\nGo back or forward in time and define other events that are connected to the spark event.\nThe Past §\nLook at the NPCs, especially the ones closer to the Spark.\n\nWhat choices did they make?\nWhat events must they have experienced to bring them to this moment?\n\nThis can introduce new NPCs and how they are involved.\nDon’t go too much behind, otherwise it’s just history.\nTo have a meaningful event, the effect of this past event must still be felt in the present. For example, someone benefitting from this event, or suffering from it to this day.\nThe Future §\nSimilar to Fronts in Dungeon World.\nHow will the situation evolve without the PCs?\nFor each NPCs:\n\nWhat will they do next?\n\nThis can generate new NPCs and also new transgressive events, from desperation or retaliation.\nStep 3: Key Events §\nFrom this timeline, make a list of the most critical events. Can be dramatic, but also important from a financial or romantic POV.\nFor each of these events, note down finer details.\nDon’t need to be clues, but should be better detailed.\n\nThings the PCs might ask or do\n\nPossible questions to answer:\n\nWhere, exactly, did the event take place?\nWhat are the finer details of the significant actions taken during the event?\nWho was present? What was their reaction to what transpired?\nWhat did they do immediately afterward?\nDid any unexpected things intrude on the proceedings, or did any of the people involved make a mistake or suddenly change course from their original intentions?\n\nExtra §\nHow to handle supernatural elements? §\nShould not be the the mystery’s focus.\nA list of possible supernatural elements:\n\nPeople, based on ancestry, culture (alien, fantasy, whatever). They remain people though, but can have weird implications of social behaviours or how they do things thanks to innate powers or abilities, for example.\nLocation property. Can be something happening in the scenario, breaking reality somehow and pushing people to act.\nAs by-product of ordinary people transgression.\nAs catalyst of people drama, like vampires, warewolves.\n\nHow do people in a community react to this sudden stress? That’s the point of the story, not the supernatural.\n\n\nIn general, if resolving the supernatural issue brings back the status quo, you need to add more troubles between NPCs.\n\nNPCs should be akin to DM PCs.

Can be ally, with their own agenda on how to do things.\n\nKey thing: NPCs need to be following their plans, which will result in a kind of interference in normal clue gathering.\n\n\n\n\nIf PCs don’t have a reason to get the hook:\n\nPut them in the direct path of one of the NPCs following their agenda.\n\nNot as quest giver, but as a dramatic interaction.\n\nTest: Is NPC using the PCs to accomplish something they can’t do themselves? If yes, quest giver, bad. If not, peer interaction, good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCs become involved indirectly through the interaction of 2+ NPCs.\n\nThe PCs are involved in the consequence of this interaction.\n\n\nOne of PCs backstory issues is the centre of the scene.\n\n\n\nOpening  scene ideas:\n\nSome aspect of a NPC’s well-being is suddenly placed in the PCs’ hands.\nA NPC takes advantage of a PC personally or professionally, intentionally or opportunistically.\nA PC witness a NPC doing something that should not have been observed.\nA NPC attempts to harm a PC directly.\n\nMiddle §\nMystery stories are character dramas about digging up things other would rather stay buried.\nGM needs to play NPC’s desire to keep it buried.\nClues §\nShould never just point to another source of info (lead).\nExpository Clues §\nReveal facts about past events on the timeline.\nFound by looking for them.\nOften found my minor NPCs and reported on by social interaction or other report.\nScenes about it should be kept short but truthful to explain the situation.\nDramatic Clues §\nExposes the dramatic stakes of the situation, revealing something emotional or psychological about a NPC OR illuminates a relationship between two NPCs.\nHow to manage the moment to moment gameplay §\nDo a list of Clues, divided in Expository or Dramatic like in LazyDM.\nIn a separate, new section of the LazyDM steps, for each Key Event, answer the questions in Step 3 Key Events.\nPossible structures of Interpersonal Drama §\nThe focus of any scene should be: How do the characters treat each other?\nAka, focus should be on exposing a Clue, which gives info about 1+ NPCs.\nA list of dramatic tensions that often arise between characters in mysteries.\n• Tensions between personal responsibility and obligations and the needs of the investigation. (These tensions often arise between close relations).\n• Tensions over how the investigation should be focused or proceed, especially over the handling of persons of interest and other sensitive information. (These tensions can often arise between allies).\n• Tensions that arise when characters try to take advantage of each other to further a personal agenda.

Cross out all references to that Character on the Characters List. If there are no non-Player Characters, then re-roll for another Meta Plot Point. This change can be reflected in the activity in this Turning Point or not. For instance, you may explain the Character being removed from the Adventure by having that Character die in the Turning Point. Or, you simply remove them from the Characters List and decide that their involvement in the Adventure is over.

If this would remove a Player Character completely from the List, or if when rolling for the Character you get a result of \\&quot;New Character\\&quot;, then treat this as a result of \\&quot;Choose The Most Logical Character\\&quot;.

This change can be reflected in the activity in this Turning Point or not.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CHARACTER DOWNGRADE&quot;, 73, &quot;A Character becomes less important, remove them from two slots on the Characters List even if it removes them completely from the List.

To know the unknown, you have to commit to it. For instance, a magic portal where there is no way of knowing what’s on the other side except by walking through it. Or, you discover a machine that is very powerful but you have no idea what it does, except if you turn it on. The only way to discover the unknown is to engage it, when it will be too late if you regret it.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CHARACTER IS ATTACKED IN A NON-LETHAL WAY&quot;, 26,0,0,0,0, &quot;A Character is attacked, but the assailant will not attack to kill.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A NEEDED RESOURCE RUNS OUT&quot;, 0,27,0,0,0, &quot;A resource a Character needs has run out. The lack will cause problems. For instance, traveling a dinosaur filled jungle and running out of ammunition.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;USEFUL INFORMATION FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE&quot;, 0,0,28,0,0, &quot;A Character receives useful information from an anonymous source. Perhaps a note is found laying on your doorstep, or an email appears in your inbox with a photo that reveals something to the Character. Whatever the information is, it should impact the Plotline.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;IMPENDING DOOM&quot;, 0,28,0,0,0, &quot;Something terrible is going to happen, and it is approaching. For instance, an enemy army is advancing to invade and will be at the borders in a week.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;OUTCAST&quot;, 0,0,0,26,0, &quot;A Character is considered an outcast by other Characters for some reason. Maybe the Character is part of an ethnic group that is disliked in the area, or perhaps the Character is popularly believed to be the perpetrator of a heinous crime.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PERSUASION&quot;, 0,0,0,0,26, &quot;A Character tries to persuade another Character to do something. This persuasion can take many forms, from pleading with them to threatening them, for instance.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A MOTIVE FREE CRIME&quot;, 0,29,30,0,0, &quot;A crime is committed either in this Turning Point or is learned about in this Turning Point, with no clear reason why the crime was committed. Maybe someone was murdered for no obvious reason, or a building was broken into with nothing stolen.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;COLLATERAL DAMAGE&quot;, 27,30,0,0,0, &quot;Whatever is going on in this Turning Point, the activity will spill over from the focus of that activity to things around it. This is particularly true for damaging events. For instance, a superhero defeats a villain in a downtown brawl, but doing significant damage to the buildings around them in the process. The collateral damage does not have to be physical. For instance, it could be the legal fallout from a major court decision.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SHADY PLACES&quot;, 0,32,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a location that is less than legitimate, such as a back alley where drug deals are commonly transacted or a secret gambling hall in a bar.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CHARACTER IS ATTACKED IN A LETHAL WAY&quot;, 29,0,0,0,0, &quot;An assailant is trying to kill a Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DO IT, OR ELSE&quot;, 0,33,0,0,27, &quot;A Character is being given a task, and is being pressured into completing the task with a threat. For instance, a spy is forcing a diplomat to hand over technology secrets or he will expose the diplomat’s illegal activities and send him to jail. Of course, probably the most common form of this Plot Point is “Do this or I will kill you”.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;REMOTE LOCATION&quot;, 0,34,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a remote location, such as a cave or a cabin in the woods.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AMBUSH&quot;, 31,0,0,0,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point involves sudden action at an unexpected time.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SOLD!&quot;, 0,0,0,28,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a sale of some kind. Maybe goods are being sold, or information is being bought. Whatever is happening, goods and money are exchanging hands.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CATASTROPHE&quot;, 32,35,0,0,0, &quot;Just about the worst thing that can happen does happen, and it happens spectacularly and with much action. This could be the impregnable fortress that gets sacked, the unstoppable superhero who gets defeated, the unsinkable ship that starts to sink.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;GRISLY TONE&quot;, 0,36,0,0,0, &quot;Whatever is going on in this Turning Point, the tone of it is grisly, something that causes horror or disgust. For instance, if a note is discovered with a grisly tone it may be smeared in blood or be accompanied by a severed hand.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CHARACTER HAS A CLEVER IDEA&quot;, 33,0,0,0,0, &quot;A Character has an idea that has an impact on this Turning Point. For instance, the con man speaks up and just happens to know a secret way through the sewers into the walled city.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SOMETHING IS GETTING AWAY&quot;, 34,37,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a time limit where, at the end of it, something will get away. For instance, a ship carrying a magic artifact is about to leave the dock and a Character has to fight their way through a pack of armed goons to board the ship before it sets sail.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;RETALIATION&quot;, 0,39,0,30,28, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, it involves an element of retaliation or revenge.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CHARACTER DISAPPEARS&quot;, 0,40,32,0,0, &quot;A Character is nowhere to be found. Whether there is evidence or not as to what happened to the Character is up to you depending on the other Plot Points involved in this Turning Point.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HUNTED&quot;, 36,41,0,0,0, &quot;A Character is being hunted by someone or something that is not strictly legitimate. In other words, as opposed to Wanted By The Law, Hunted may mean a hit man is pursuing a Character to fulfill a mafia contract on them, or a ghost may be after a Character. The hunter doesn’t have to be seeking to kill.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A HIGH ENERGY GATHERING&quot;, 0,0,0,31,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a social gathering with a great deal of energy or activity. This could be a busy nightclub, a loud party, or a sporting event, for instance.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A RARE OR UNIQUE SOCIAL GATHERING&quot;, 0,0,0,32,0, &quot;This is a social gathering for a specific and rare purpose. Examples would include funerals or a wedding.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;BAD DECISION&quot;, 0,42,0,0,29, &quot;A decision a Character made has turned out to be a very bad one. This can be a decision made earlier in the Adventure, or it can be something from before the Adventure. This earlier decision may not have seemed like a bad one at the time, but it has turned out to be bad, either for the Character, for others, or both. For instance, maybe a ship’s captain decided to investigate a distress beacon in deep space, only to find it’s a trap laid by pirates.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THIS ISN’T WORKING&quot;, 0,0,33,0,0, &quot;Something that is supposed to be working is not for some reason, causing a problem. For instance, a binding spell is failing to hold a demon, or a crime boss is delivering stolen goods through a shipping port that is supposed to be secure but turns out to be swarming with police. Whatever isn’t working is something that was assumed would work.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DISTRACTION&quot;, 37,0,0,0,0, &quot;A Character is distracted in this Turning Point in such a way that it impacts events. For instance, before a villain delivers his killing blow he’s distracted by an image of his lost love, giving the hero time to escape.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ILL WILL&quot;, 0,0,0,0,31, &quot;A Character harbors ill will toward another Character for some reason. The animosity should be deep seated and color the Character’s reactions when it comes to the unliked Character. The dislike may be reciprocated or not.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AN ORGANIZATION&quot;, 0,0,0,34,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves an organization of some kind. This can be an organization already in the Characters List or not. Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, the organization is formally involved in some way. For instance, a crime has been committed and a local guild had knowledge of it and covered it up to protect its own interests.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;WANTED BY THE LAW&quot;, 0,43,0,0,33, &quot;A Character is wanted for a crime. It doesn’t matter if they actually did the crime, but the law is after them as the main suspect either way.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A RESOURCE DISAPPEARS&quot;, 0,0,35,0,0, &quot;An important object or resource is stolen by an unknown thief. The resource should be something either useful to a Character, or it should pertain to the Plotline in question.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;IT IS YOUR DUTY&quot;, 0,0,0,0,35, &quot;A Character is charged with carrying out a duty. This should be something that the Character has little choice in the matter, whether they want to do it or not. Whoever the duty is coming from, that source has authority over the Character. For instance, a soldier wants to join in the pivotal battle but his commander gives him the duty of guarding the fortress gate instead.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FORTUITOUS FIND&quot;, 0,0,36,0,0, &quot;A Character runs across something very useful for resolving the Plotline. This may be a piece of information, a useful tool, a resource that is needed, a person who can help, etc. Whatever it is, it’s the right thing at the right time, and it falls into the Character’s lap.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CHARACTER CONNECTION SEVERED&quot;, 0,0,0,0,37, &quot;A Character who has a connection with another Character severs that connection. This can happen for any of a number of reasons, from the Character dropping out of the story to the Character getting angry at the other Character for something. The severed connection does not have to be permanent.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ALL IS REVEALED!&quot;, 0,0,37,0,0, &quot;A source in this Turning Point gives a lot of detail about something. For instance, a guard is captured and tells where the king has hidden the Sacred Scrolls.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HUMILIATION&quot;, 0,0,0,0,38, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character being humiliated or facing humiliation. Whatever is happening, it should be something deeply embarrassing to the Character. For instance, a member of an unpopular community is being bullied and mocked, or a public figure has something personal publicly exposed.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PEOPLE BEHAVING BADLY&quot;, 0,0,0,35,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves someone behaving in a socially unacceptable way. For example, a group of drunks throwing bottles, or a heckler in a crowd yelling at a speaker.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;USEFUL INFORMATION FROM A KNOWN SOURCE&quot;, 0,0,39,0,0, &quot;A Character acquires useful information from a known source. For instance, a detective investigating a homicide gets a tip from an informant she sometimes uses, giving her a clue.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CRYPTIC INFORMATION FROM A KNOWN SOURCE&quot;, 0,0,40,0,0, &quot;A Character acquires information that is not immediately useful from a known source. The information is cryptic, the Character doesn’t know what it means. For instance, a crewmember leaves behind a note to be found that simply says, “Kraton,” where the Character receiving the note has no idea what “Kraton” is.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;LIE DISCOVERED&quot;, 0,0,42,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves the discovery of a lie. The lie could have happened within this Turning Point, or it could have happened earlier in the Adventure or even before the Adventure. For instance, Characters may learn that the detective did not destroy the cult artifact like he said he did, but instead took it home to try and summon the Beast From Beyond.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CHARACTER IS ATTACKED TO ABDUCT&quot;, 39,0,0,0,0, &quot;An assailant is attempting to abduct a Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SOMETHING EXOTIC&quot;, 40,44,43,0,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it involves an unusual or exotic element. For instance, if the Turning Point is about someone being attacked by an assassin, the assassin may have a very unusual identity or mode of attack (maybe he’s disguised as a clown and attacks with exploding balloons, or he is a martial artist with fantastic moves).&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;IMMEDIATELY&quot;, 42,45,0,0,0, &quot;Immediate action is required in this Turning Point, whatever is going on. For instance, if this Turning Point involves engine failure on a starship, the Character doesn’t have days to resolve the issue, he may only have an hour. Whatever is going on, it requires immediate action.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FAME&quot;, 0,0,0,36,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point involves someone famous to some extent. This doesn’t necessarily mean that a famous Character is Invoked, just that the Turning Point has some connection to fame. For instance, if this Turning Point involves learning a secret about another Character, you may learn that they were once a member of a famous superhero group decades ago.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CHASE&quot;, 44,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a chase, where one Character is pursuing another.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;BETRAYAL!&quot;, 0,46,0,0,40, &quot;A Character, who was thought to be an ally or to be benign, turns on another Character. This can be a fundamental betrayal, such as they are actually on opposing sides, or it can be a momentary betrayal, such as attacking someone out of a fit of anger.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CRIME IS COMMITTED&quot;, 0,0,45,0,0, &quot;A crime is committed either in this Turning Point or is learned about in this Turning Point.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CHARACTER IS INCAPACITATED&quot;, 0,47,0,0,42, &quot;A Character is rendered out of commission for some reason. Perhaps they are wounded badly, they lose their powers, are trapped somewhere, etc.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;IT’S A SECRET&quot;, 0,0,47,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves an activity that is done in secret, such as smuggling or embezzlement. The activity doesn’t have to be illegal, but whatever it is, it is something hidden or being done behind an otherwise legitimate front. For instance, a fast food chain is using it’s delivery trucks to smuggle drugs across the border.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SOMETHING LOST HAS BEEN FOUND&quot;, 0,0,48,0,0, &quot;Something that has been lost turns up in this Turning Point. The thing could have been lost in this Adventure or before. It can be an object, a person, or anything. For instance, a ring of power suddenly turns up in a creek bed, or a Character who disappeared early in the Adventure suddenly makes a reappearance.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SCAPEGOAT&quot;, 0,0,0,37,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves an innocent Character accused of wrongdoing to throw suspicion off of the real culprit. For instance, the woman who took all the ammo blames the newcomer to the zombie survivalist group, or the mayor of the little New England town blames the practitioners of a religion for the bizarre events going on when he is actually at fault.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;NOWHERE TO RUN&quot;, 0,48,0,0,0, &quot;A Character faces a peril with no means to escape.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AT NIGHT&quot;, 0,50,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point takes place at night.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THE OBSERVER&quot;, 0,0,49,38,43, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point that is presumed to be private from someone, is actually being witnessed or observed. The observed are not aware of this observer. For instance, two enemy generals are meeting in secret to form an alliance and betray their respective kings, but the meeting is observed by a princess who knows exactly what it means.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ESCAPE&quot;, 46,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves an escape of some sort. For instance, a Character who was captured by brigands in an earlier Turning Point manages to slip away from his captors and escape into the forest.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A SECRET WEAPON&quot;, 0,51,50,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves the reveal of a secret weapon in possession by a Character. This weapon should be significant enough to sway the balance of power or to otherwise require a solution to resolve. For instance, the motley band of orcs is unexpectedly backed by a large ogre whose aid they enlisted. Or, the galactic empire unveils a new, planet-busting warship that changes everything&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HEAVILY GUARDED&quot;, 48,52,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves entering a heavily guarded and dangerous location. For instance, this could be needing to infiltrate a high tech security facility to steal information, or breaking into the necromancers lair full of guardian zombies to destroy his magic crystal.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;RESCUE&quot;, 50,0,0,0,0, &quot;A Character needs to be rescued in this Turning Point.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;LIAR!&quot;, 0,0,52,39,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves an active lie. The lie is being committed in this Turning Point. Something someone said or claimed is false. For instance, a vampire lord claims he knows nothing of a magic book, when actually he is seeking it himself. The lie may or may not be detected in this Turning Point.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HOME SWEET HOME&quot;, 0,0,0,0,45, &quot;This Turning Point takes place in the private home of a Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CHARACTER ACTS OUT OF CHARACTER&quot;, 0,0,53,0,0, &quot;A Character does something that runs counter to that Character’s perceived goals or personality. The action may seem at odds to how they’ve been acting (such as a trusted member of a team sabotaging a crucial resource) or the action is vague with no discernible purpose (such as a Character meeting with an unknown person in secret).&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HEADQUARTERS&quot;, 0,0,0,41,46, &quot;A setting in this Turning Point is a Character’s main headquarters. For instance, it may be the ritzy bar where the mob boss runs his empire, or the wizard’s wilderness tower.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PHYSICAL CONTEST OF SKILLS&quot;, 52,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves Characters squaring off against each other in a physical contest of skills. This can be anything such as combat, a sporting event, duel, arm wrestling contest, etc.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DEAD&quot;, 0,53,54,0,0, &quot;A Character is dead. This can either be expected or unexpected, but whatever the circumstances, this Turning Point involves a dead Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A COMMON SOCIAL GATHERING&quot;, 0,0,0,43,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a social gathering. This can be any gathering of people, generally for a common purpose, such as gathering for dinner at a home or restaurant, or an afternoon at a mall. The social gathering itself should be considered of a mundane nature, although what else transpires at the gathering doesn’t necessarily have to be.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;LIGHT URBAN SETTING&quot;, 0,0,0,45,0, &quot;This Turning Point takes place in a light urban setting, such as a small town or village.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;MYSTERY SOLVED&quot;, 0,0,56,0,0, &quot;A mystery is solved. This can be a large, unanswered question in the Adventure or something minor, but it is not a Plotline resolved unless this Turning Point is also a Plotline Conclusion. A Mystery Solved could be any number of things, from finally figuring out what a device does to locating the missing Chancellor.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A WORK RELATED GATHERING&quot;, 0,0,0,47,0, &quot;This is a social gathering that involves professionals or workers. The gathering itself may or may not involve their actual work. For instance, police officers gathering at a “cop bar” or a team of super heroes gathering at their headquarters would both count.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FAMILY MATTERS&quot;, 0,0,0,0,48, &quot;This Turning Point involves a family member or members of a Character. For instance, an occult investigator is about to head off on a mission when his sister unexpectedly appears on his doorstep, or one of the Characters has an uncle who is a feudal lord and is summoning them for their help in defending his land because no one else will stand by him.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SECRET INFORMATION LEAKED&quot;, 0,0,57,0,0, &quot;Information that should not have gotten into the wrong hands has. For instance, outlaws always seem to know when the stagecoach is coming through Gateway Gulch with the railroad payroll. How are they finding out? Or, an enemy spy has learned of the realm’s secret military plans.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SUSPICION&quot;, 0,54,59,48,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character being suspicious of another Character for some reason. For instance, a beloved leader on a space station is murdered and suddenly every newcomer on board is viewed with suspicion.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;LOSE LOSE&quot;, 0,55,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a choice where both or all options are bad in some way.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A FIGURE FROM THE PAST&quot;, 0,0,0,0,49, &quot;A new Character joins the Adventure, someone from a Character’s past. This Plot Point requires a new Character to be added to the Characters List and Invoked.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;MASS BATTLE&quot;, 54,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a combat between many combatants. This can be a throw down between two teams or a battle in a war, for instance.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;OUT IN THE OPEN&quot;, 0,56,0,0,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, it is happening out in the open for all to see. For instance, a Character is attacked at a public festival in the middle of the day, or, something a Character is doing that they thought is private is actually being filmed and viewed by others.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;EVIDENCE&quot;, 0,0,61,0,0, &quot;A Character finds something that helps settle an existing question. For instance, the gun that killed a victim is found stashed under a suspect’s bed.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CHARACTER IS DIMINISHED&quot;, 0,58,0,0,51, &quot;A Character is reduced in some way that makes them less effective. Perhaps they are wounded, or their energy is low, or they lose some authority, etc. The Character is not entirely powerless, but loses a significant portion of their power or utility.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THE PLOT THICKENS&quot;, 0,0,63,0,0, &quot;A promising lead or clue to solving an open question turns out to be a dead end. For instance, Characters follow through on a tip to go to a warehouse to find an abducted heiress, but instead of finding a nest of bad guys they just find an empty building.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ENEMIES&quot;, 0,59,0,49,53, &quot;This Turning Point involves enemies of a Character. Whatever activity is going on in this Turning Point, those enemies play an important role.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DUBIOUS RATIONALE&quot;, 0,0,64,0,0, &quot;A Character does something that is in keeping with their Character, but the action could also have been for another reason and it is not clear which reason the Character acted on. For instance, the CEO goes into his office late at night, as he sometimes does, on the same night another executive is murdered. The action should seem innocent, except for other events or information that cast doubt on it.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;MENACING TONE&quot;, 0,60,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a menacing tone of some kind. For instance, one Character may be threatening another Character, or a villain may be gloating over a captured opponent.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CRUCIAL LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM BEGINS TO FAIL&quot;, 55,61,65,0,0, &quot;This can be an actual life support system, like the oxygen ventilation of a starship, or a safety system, like the brakes on a car. The failure will constitute an emergency for the Characters involved.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DENSE URBAN SETTING&quot;, 0,0,0,51,0, &quot;This Turning Point takes place in a heavily urban area, such as a large city.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DOING THE RIGHT THING&quot;, 0,0,0,0,54, &quot;A Character who is acting in bad faith in some way has a change of heart and decides to do the right thing. For instance, a con man stealing medicine from a diseased community decides he can’t leave all those people to die.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;VICTORY!&quot;, 57,62,0,0,0, &quot;A Character achieves a victory over another Character in this Turning Point. For instance, a band of marauders successfully waylay the king’s couriers, or a hacker worms his way into a corporate computer system.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;TAKING CHANCES&quot;, 59,63,0,0,0, &quot;A Character acts in a very risky way. For instance, a Character may suddenly show no regard for their life as they walk out across a narrow beam above a valley to save a friend. Or, the villain you are fighting takes a drug that makes him go into a battle frenzy where he loses all caution.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A GROUP IS IN TROUBLE&quot;, 0,0,0,53,0, &quot;A group, such as a community, is in trouble in this Plot Point. The group or community is facing a difficulty. For instance, maybe a village is being harassed by monsters, or a corporation is facing a lawsuit that could destroy it. Whatever the trouble is, it should be something that can be solved and will likely constitute a problem for a Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SOLE SURVIVOR&quot;, 61,64,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves some kind of process of elimination where there is only one left. This can be a battle, but doesn’t have to be. For instance, maybe a sinking ship has a single survivor who washes up on shore, or a group of crewmen from a starship playing chess with an alien intelligence is down to their last crewmember who is now chosen for the alien’s ultimate challenge.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;TOKEN RESPONSE&quot;, 0,0,0,54,0, &quot;A Character or organization acting in this Turning Point does the bare minimum to address a problem, or makes just a token effort, as opposed to doing something truly effective. For instance, a notorious space pirate has been captured, but instead of receiving serious prison time, the federation government goes very lenient on him and releases him from prison in a week.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CRYPTIC INFORMATION FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE&quot;, 0,0,67,0,0, &quot;Information that is unclear what it means is received from an anonymous source. Maybe an odd word is found scrawled on a mirror, or a stranger’s diary is found talking about events similar to the Plotline.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A COMMON THREAD&quot;, 0,0,69,0,0, &quot;It is learned that events that appeared to be unrelated have a commonality after all. For instance, a rash of crimes has beset the city, from car jackings to break ins. It turns out the culprits all work as security guards in the same building.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A PROBLEM RETURNS&quot;, 0,66,0,0,0, &quot;A problem that had been thought resolved returns in some fashion. This can be a problem from this Adventure, from a previous Adventure, or something inferred from the past. For instance, a kingdom may be enjoying a decade of peace following the vanquishing of the Dark Lord, but it is discovered that he is not dead and is now returning. The magnitude of the problem is open to interpretation and can range from large to minor, such as a previously sealed leak in a boat has sprung open again.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;STUCK&quot;, 0,68,0,0,0, &quot;A Character is stuck in this Turning Point, unable to act, while the events of the Turning Point transpire. Whatever has them stuck is not necessarily permanent, but at the moment it renders them powerless or mostly powerless. For instance, maybe the character is bound or trapped in a jail cell.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AT YOUR MERCY&quot;, 0,0,0,0,56, &quot;A Character is helpless and desperate for some reason, and must rely on the mercy of another Character who has the power to address their problem. For instance, a Character is afflicted with a magical curse that only one sorcerer can cure.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;STOP THAT&quot;, 63,0,0,0,0, &quot;A Character takes action to stop something from happening in this Turning Point. The action could be expected, such as a hero putting an arrow through the executioner before he drops his axe. Or, it could be unexpected, like a Character suddenly shooting a captured villain right before he was about to reveal crucial details.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;NOT THEIR MASTER&quot;, 0,0,70,55,0, &quot;A Character in this Turning Point who is assumed to be working for one source turns out to be working for another. For instance, the hitman who’s been trying to kill a Character doesn’t work for the mafia like you thought, but for a corporation who has an interest in that Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FALL FROM POWER&quot;, 0,0,0,0,58, &quot;A Character loses their power in this Turning Point. For instance, a king is found to be a fraud by his brother, who asserts his own claim to the throne and takes it.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HELP IS OFFERED, FOR A PRICE&quot;, 0,0,0,0,60, &quot;A Character offers to help another Character in exchange for something. What’s being asked for could be anything, from mutual aid to a fee. Whatever the price, it should be steep enough to be of real significance to the paying Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PUBLIC LOCATION&quot;, 0,0,0,57,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a public location, such as a town square or a park in the middle of the day.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THE LEADER&quot;, 0,0,0,59,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves the leader of someone or some organization.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PRIZED POSSESSION&quot;, 0,0,0,0,62, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, it involves an important possession of a Character. For instance, if the Turning Point is about something being stolen, maybe a sorcerer’s magic staff is taken.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SAVIOR&quot;, 0,0,0,61,0, &quot;A Character is involved in this Turning Point who offers to save the day.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DISARMED&quot;, 0,70,0,0,63, &quot;A Character loses their primary method of defending themselves. This could mean the loss of a weapon, or maybe a powerful bureaucrat is powerless in another’s kingdom, etc. The disarmament should be temporary for the Turning Point and deprive the Character of crucial defenses.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THE SECRET TO THE POWER&quot;, 0,0,72,0,0, &quot;There is a power, and it has a secret source. For instance, an evil wizard may derive his abilities from his ancient staff, or the warship hurtling through space may be dependent on a simple power core inside that will cripple the ship if it is damaged. This secret gives Characters an option to stop an otherwise overwhelming or powerful problem.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HIDDEN AGENDA&quot;, 0,0,74,0,0, &quot;A Character either reveals, or is found out to have, a motive that they had not previously exposed. For instance, maybe the detective isn’t investigating the murder out of dedication to his job, but the victim used to be a love interest of his. Classically, this can also be the ally who turns out to be an enemy. The hidden agenda doesn’t have to be something nefarious, although it can be. Whichever the case, the agenda now becomes known to others.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DEFEND OR NOT TO DEFEND&quot;, 65,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a confrontation between two Characters, where another Character views it and has the option to intervene or not. The observing Character is not directly part of the confrontation, but will become so if they step in. This Plot Point calls for three Characters to be Invoked.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CRASH&quot;, 67,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a vehicle carrying a Character to crash or threaten to crash. The Character(s) involved must either mitigate the damage of the crash, prevent the crash in the first place, and/or survive the crash. The vehicle can be anything from a plane to a car to a snow sled ... anything that can transport a Character and its crashing would be dangerous.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;REINFORCEMENTS&quot;, 0,0,0,63,0, &quot;A Character who is running low on a human resource gets a boost. For instance, the battle is going poorly for King Leonard, but just before they lose King Ferdinand appears on the hill with his forces ready to save the day.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;GOVERNMENT&quot;, 0,0,0,65,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves government in some way. Maybe a Character has to deal with a border crossing checkpoint, or a starship needs to get proper authorization to leave port.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PHYSICAL BARRIER TO OVERCOME&quot;, 69,0,0,0,0, &quot;A Character faces a physical barrier of some sort that must be overcome. It could be a cliff that needs to be climbed, a rickety bridge to cross, a door that needs to be knocked down, etc. Whatever the barrier is, it will require physical action to get past.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;INJUSTICE&quot;, 0,0,0,67,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a social injustice of some kind. For instance, a corrupt politician uses a civic ordinance to foreclose on an apartment building where friends of a certain hero, who has upset the politician, live.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;QUIET CATASTROPHE&quot;, 0,71,0,0,0, &quot;Just about the worst thing that can happen does happen. This is similar to the Action Plot Point Catastrophe, except that it is accompanied by less action. For instance, a colonizing spaceship stops midway through a 40 year journey, waking everyone up from their cryo sleep. Or, the investigator discovers the ancient vampire he had destroyed is, somehow, back.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AN OBJECT OF UNKNOWN USE IS FOUND&quot;, 0,0,75,0,0, &quot;A Character finds something that they think is useful, but they do not know in what way. This may be a magic wand that they don’t know how to use, a key that they don’t know the lock it goes to, a device with an unknown purpose but currently has no power, etc.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;IT’S ALL ABOUT YOU&quot;, 0,0,0,0,65, &quot;Whatever the main action of this Turning Point, it is focused primarily on one Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A CELEBRATION&quot;, 0,0,0,69,0, &quot;This Plot Point involves a celebration of some sort, such as a birthday party or a high school graduation party.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;STANDOFF&quot;, 0,72,0,70,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves two or more Characters in a tense standoff. For instance, a group of mercenaries have the Characters pinned down behind rubble with gunfire, while the Characters fire back. Neither side can take out the other, but neither can they leave without resolving the conflict.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DOUBLE DOWN&quot;, 71,0,0,0,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, those events will intensify. For instance, if a ship is leaking on the high seas during a storm, maybe torrential winds tear down the sails.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HIDDEN THREAT&quot;, 0,73,0,0,0, &quot;There is a threat in this Turning Point that has been in the Adventure previous to this Turning Point but went undetected. This could be anything from an evil spirit lurking in an ancient vase to a virus in a person’s body to a good guy who turns out to be a bad guy, etc.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CHARACTER CONNECTION&quot;, 0,0,0,0,67, &quot;A Character forms a connection with another Character. This connection can be anything from showing a personal interest in the Character to asking them to become a business partner, etc. Whatever the connection is, it will have a lasting impact beyond this Turning Point.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;RELIGION&quot;, 0,0,0,71,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves some aspect of religion or religious belief. For instance, maybe an event is taking place at a church, or Characters stumble upon a cult preparing a magic ritual for their otherworldly god.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;INNOCENCE&quot;, 0,0,0,72,68, &quot;This Turning Point involves an element of innocence, usually an innocent person in an otherwise less than innocent situation. For instance, an average citizen finds herself in the middle of two vampires battling. This can also be considered a “fish out of water” Plot Point, where someone who does not belong in a situation finds themselves in that situation.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CLEAR THE RECORD&quot;, 0,0,76,0,0, &quot;A Character is given the task of clearing someone or something of a false claim. For instance, a friend says they are wrongly convicted of a crime and that the evidence is out there to prove it. The task may come to the Character officially, given by another Character, or it may be something that falls into their lap, such as discovering the truth themselves and only they know it. For instance, a foreign power has staged a catastrophe to start a war, but a handful of Characters know the truth ... if only they can reach headquarters in time to tell them before warships are launched.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;WILLING TO TALK&quot;, 0,0,0,0,70, &quot;A Character is in a mood to talk. Whatever it is they have to say, it’s important to furthering the Plotline.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THEFT&quot;, 73,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a theft, whether attempted or successful. What is being stolen is an object of some kind, or information, or anything that can be taken. This Turning Point involves the actual activity and action of the theft or attempted theft. For instance, the Character is strolling through a museum when a group of men burst in to steal a ritual mask.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CHARACTER HARM&quot;, 0,0,0,0,72, &quot;A Character hurts another Character in some personal way. For instance, a villain harms a wizard’s familiar or a Character hurls a personal insult at another Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A NEED TO HIDE&quot;, 0,75,0,0,0, &quot;A Character must hide from something or someone in this Turning Point. For instance, the Character may have escaped from a bounty hunter but must hide long enough to recover their wounds. Or, a terrible storm has struck and the Character must take shelter, hiding from the storm.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FOLLOWED&quot;, 0,77,0,0,0, &quot;A Character is being followed by another Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FRAMED&quot;, 0,0,77,0,73, &quot;A Character is unfairly framed by another Character. For instance, a mob boss plants evidence to make it look like a police detective has committed a crime.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PREPARATION&quot;, 0,0,0,74,75, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character needing to prepare for something. For instance, a wizard must study up on how to banish demons before a villain arrives, or a town of prospectors and merchants must learn how to fight before the band of outlaws arrives to exact their revenge for hanging a comrade.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AN IMPROBABLE CRIME&quot;, 0,0,78,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a crime that seems either improbable or impossible to have occurred, such as someone found murdered in a secure room or a piece of artwork stolen from a museum with no visible break in.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FRIEND FOCUS&quot;, 0,0,0,0,76, &quot;Whatever the main action of this Turning Point, it is focused on a friend or someone close to a Character. This friend can be an already existing Character in the Adventure or someone not on the Characters List. Whoever the friend is attached to, that is the Character Invoked, not the friend.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;UNTOUCHABLE&quot;, 0,0,0,0,77, &quot;A Character is, in some manner, untouchable by others in this Turning Point. For instance, a villain who is a world leader and thus can’t be directly attacked without triggering an international incident, or a superhero who is nearly impervious to harm. The untouchableness should serve a plot purpose, so that Characters are forced to take other actions to advance the Plotline.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;BRIBE&quot;, 0,0,0,0,78, &quot;A Character is offered a bribe by another Character to do something that is not legitimate. For instance, a villain may offer money to a Character if they walk away from a murder scene.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DEALING WITH A CALAMITY&quot;, 75,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character having to “fight” a calamity of some kind. For instance, maybe the Character is battling a fire to put it out, or he must fight his way through an ancient stone temple as it collapses around him.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SUDDEN CESSATION&quot;, 77,0,0,0,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, it will suddenly cease. This could occur at any time and the causes may be unknown. For instance, if Characters are attacked by a group, the group may suddenly break off and run away.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;IT’S A TRAP!&quot;, 0,79,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a trap of some kind. This can be a physical trap, such as adventurers falling prey to a pit in a hallway, to other kinds of traps, such as the summons to the peace negotiation was really just a ruse to get the leader in sights for an assassination.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A MEETING OF MINDS&quot;, 0,0,0,75,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves two Characters coming together for a discussion of importance.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;TIME LIMIT&quot;, 0,81,0,0,0, &quot;A task must be accomplished within a certain amount of time or a Character will suffer consequences. The time limit does not need to expire within this Turning Point and could extend beyond it further into the Adventure, but it should terminate within this Adventure to give the Characters a reason to accomplish the task. Failure to accomplish the task should be significant. For instance, if a cure to a toxin isn’t found within a day, the prince will die.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THE HIDDEN HAND&quot;, 0,0,80,0,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it is clear that it was caused on purpose by someone of unknown identity. For instance, if a Character is ambushed by bandits, the bandit leader may make a mysterious reference to their “benefactor” having paid for the attack. Or, an engine failure on a ship may be found to have been caused by obvious tampering.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A NEEDED RESOURCE IS RUNNING SHORT&quot;, 0,83,0,0,0, &quot;A resource a Character needs is running low and will need to be replenished. This causes problems for the Character. For instance, a starship’s warp engine functions on crystals that are running out.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ORGANIZATIONS IN CONFLICT&quot;, 0,0,0,76,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves two or more organizations that are at odds with each other. For instance, two rival mafia organizations may be trying to capture a master counterfeiter to use for their own purposes.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;BAD NEWS&quot;, 0,85,0,0,0, &quot;Something negative that happens in this Turning Point doesn’t happen directly in the Turning Point but is delivered in the form of information. The event happened remotely, and a Character is learning of it. For instance, Characters may learn their allies lost a crucial battle elsewhere.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CHARACTER ASSISTANCE&quot;, 0,0,0,0,80, &quot;A Character assists another Character in some way. This assistance can be anything from coming to their aid in battle to giving them a shoulder to cry on.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ASKING FOR HELP&quot;, 0,0,0,0,82, &quot;A Character approaches another Character to ask for help.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;HUNKER DOWN&quot;, 0,86,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character needing to fortify a place of refuge. For instance, a baron must shore up his castle defenses against an impending attack, or a generator must be fueled up to increase a force field’s power before a meteor storm rains down on the planet surface.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ABANDONED&quot;, 0,88,0,0,0, &quot;Something needs to be abandoned or has been abandoned already in this Turning Point. For instance, a heavily damaged starship is going to explode in two hours and must be evacuated. Or, a Character comes upon an empty village in a forest.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FIND IT OR ELSE&quot;, 0,0,82,0,0, &quot;Something needs to be found in this Turning Point to help resolve the Plotline. The act of finding the thing could take place in this Turning Point, or a Character learns of the need to find something. The thing to be found can be just about anything, from an object such as a magic ring to open a portal, to a special person like the lone witness to a crime that proves an accused person is innocent.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;USED AGAINST THEM&quot;, 78,89,0,0,0, &quot;A resource owned or aligned with one Character is somehow turned against them in this Turning Point. For instance, a small starship is being pursued by three massive battle cruisers. By skillful piloting, the smaller ship causes the larger ships to collide with each other, using their size against them. Or, a wizard may command a powerful golem, but another wizard casts a spell to make the golem attack its master.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;POWERFUL PERSON&quot;, 0,0,0,77,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a powerful person. The Character’s power can be of any nature, from a physically powerful warrior to a government figure with a lot of influence. Invoke a Character. If the Character is powerful, then that is the powerful person. If they are not, then the powerful person is someone associated with that Character in some way.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CREEPY TONE&quot;, 0,91,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a creepy tone, such as a dark and forbidding place or a Character who is extremely menacing in a disturbing way.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;WELCOME TO THE PLOT&quot;, 0,0,0,0,83, &quot;A Character learns that they are connected to this Plotline somehow in a personal way. Maybe it involves something from their past or someone in their life. For instance, a detective may discover that the crime syndicate he is trying to take down is run by his long lost brother.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;TRAVEL SETTING&quot;, 79,92,83,78,0, &quot;This Turning Point takes place in a traveling vehicle. For instance, a ship at sea, a train, a ship hurtling through space, etc.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ESCORT DUTY&quot;, 0,0,0,79,0, &quot;A Character must escort another Character somewhere. For instance, this could be a bodyguard transporting a high powered executive to a remote location, or a band of warriors trying to get a princess through a valley full of monsters.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AN OLD DEAL&quot;, 0,0,84,80,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves an agreement made long ago, probably even before this Adventure began. For instance, occult investigators researching a mysterious death discover that the deceased person sold his soul to a demon ten years ago, and they suspect the death is the demon having come to collect.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A NEW ENEMY&quot;, 0,93,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point presents a new threat to a Character. It is a threat that may or may not be directly related to any Plotlines but must be dealt with all the same. For instance, explorers deep under the earth are moving through an ancient ruin to find their lost comrade when they are beset upon by dinosaurs who nest in the area. This results automatically in a New Character.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ALLIANCE&quot;, 0,0,0,82,0, &quot;One group offers to ally with another. This may be a surprise alliance, such as an enemy wanting to join with another enemy to take on a common foe, or it could be something less dramatic, such as the FBI offering to assist local law enforcement in solving a crime. The “groups” in question can be formal organizations or something looser, such as groups of individuals.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;POWER OVER OTHERS&quot;, 0,0,0,84,0, &quot;A Character has power over other Characters in some way, shape, or form in this Turning Point. This power puts the Character in a commanding position in regards to the others. For instance, the lord of a land demands all the peasants pay high taxes or else his men will oppress them. Or, the producer of an anti-toxin for a disease that an entire village has demands they give him whatever he wants in order to receive the medicine.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A MYSTERIOUS NEW PERSON&quot;, 0,0,85,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point automatically Invokes a New Character, added to the List, whose identity or purpose is not fully known. Maybe they are a shadowy visitor at a meeting, or someone who seems to have authority over someone else.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FRENETIC ACTIVITY&quot;, 81,0,0,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves action coming fast and furious at a Character. It should be a rapid fire succession of action, for instance a series of attackers, an out of control boat rocketing down a rapids approaching peril after peril, running a gauntlet of some kind through a series of traps, etc.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;RURAL SETTING&quot;, 0,94,86,85,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a rural setting, such as out in the country or at a farm.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;LIKEABLE&quot;, 0,0,0,0,84, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character who is very likable to another Character. Whoever it is, it should be someone who generates sympathy. The Character’s likability should be strong enough to motivate the other Character’s actions. For instance, a jaded cop thought he has seen it all, but a kidnapped girl kindles in him a desire to save her and redeem himself.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SOMEONE IS WHERE THEY SHOULD NOT BE&quot;, 0,0,88,0,0, &quot;A Character is at a location where they should not normally be. For instance, an ally is seen at the headquarters of an enemy, a wealthy socialite is found meeting with a mafia boss at a restaurant, etc.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SNEAKY BARRIER&quot;, 83,0,0,0,0, &quot;A barrier needs to be overcome through stealth or dexterity. For instance, a monster lives in a cave that is only accessible by climbing a high, treacherous cliffside. Or, there are too many ninjas guarding the villain to fight your way through, but you can slip past them unseen if you are skilled enough.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CORRUPTION&quot;, 0,0,0,87,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves corruption of a social apparatus of some kind. For instance, a police officer on the take from the mob, or the villain of the Adventure turns out to be a local bureaucrat using his position to give smugglers access to a dock at night.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;VULNERABILITY EXPLOITED&quot;, 0,95,89,0,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves a vulnerability of some kind being exploited by a Character. For instance, someone knowing of another’s crime and blackmailing them, Characters learning of a starbase’s secret vulnerability that allows it to be destroyed, etc. This Turning Point can either involve learning about the vulnerability or actively exploiting it.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;THE PROMISE OF REWARD&quot;, 0,0,0,0,86, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character faced with a substantial reward for their participation. For instance, maybe a village is willing to give a group of adventurers everything they have if they fight off a band of marauding goblins. The reward should be for doing something that is considered legitimate or good.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;FRAUD&quot;, 0,0,91,0,0, &quot;A Character is a fraud. Whatever it is they are presenting themselves as, or whatever story they have told of themselves, is false. This result differs from Hidden Agenda, where in Hidden Agenda the Character may legitimately have both motives in mind, whereas in Fraud the image or story they are presenting is completely fake. For instance, the prince claiming he is the rightful ruler of a kingdom is actually a shapeshifting doppelgänger assuming the role.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;IT’S BUSINESS&quot;, 0,0,0,89,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves business or commerce in some way. It can either be a business transaction, or a business is involved in the Turning Point. For instance, a corporation hires a super hero to protect an important shipment, or a book of antiquity containing a needed spell has to be purchased from an auction house.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;JUST CAUSE GONE AWRY&quot;, 0,0,0,90,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves something that began as a just cause but has spiraled into something unjust. For instance, a hero takes down a group of orcs terrorizing a town, saving the people, but now the hero has installed himself as the overlord of the town and is demanding tribute.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;EXPERT KNOWLEDGE&quot;, 0,0,0,0,87, &quot;This Turning Point involves a Character who has very specific and specialized knowledge or skills that come into play during the Turning Point. For instance, only the genius of Dr. Rayder can figure out the intricacies of the alien device, or it’s discovered that a killer is murdering people with his knowledge of exotic poisons.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A MOMENT OF PEACE&quot;, 85,0,0,0,0, &quot;Whatever else is going on in this Turning Point, it should overall be a peaceful time for a Character. For instance, there is a lull in the war where the combatants have a chance to enjoy a drink together and relax before they must fight again.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;A FOCUS ON THE MUNDANE&quot;, 0,0,0,0,89, &quot;This Turning Point involves a focus on something mundane and ordinary, such as a person’s living room or a meal. This mundane thing may be coupled with something extraordinary in the Turning Point. For instance, a Character is killed when his nightly dinner is poisoned, or a family portrait is found to be a cursed item.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;RUN AWAY!&quot;, 0,0,0,0,91, &quot;A Character flees or has fled. The actual flight may occur in this Turning Point or it may be learned of. For instance, a Character runs screaming as a horrible monster appears on the scene, or, a Character who disappeared earlier in the Adventure is learned to have left town fearing for his life.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;BEAT YOU TO IT&quot;, 87,0,93,0,0, &quot;Whatever is happening in this Turning Point that involves arriving at a location for some purpose, a Character discovers that someone else has arrived before them. For instance, a Character goes to the morgue to check out a clue and learns that another investigator already showed up and took the body.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CONFRONTATION&quot;, 89,0,0,91,0, &quot;This Turning Point involves Characters meeting in a confrontation that may turn physical if things don’t go well. For instance, a Character meets the leader of a street gang to get information, but the gang is notoriously twitchy and violent.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;ARGUMENT&quot;, 0,0,0,93,0, &quot;A disagreement between two Characters leads to a conflict in this Turning Point.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SOCIAL TENSION SET TO BOILING&quot;, 0,0,0,94,0, &quot;An element of extreme social tension is near the breaking point. This Turning Point involves some aspect of that, such as an event that increases the tension or an event that is a result of the tension. For instance, two nations at the brink of war have a border skirmish as pressure rises among soldiers.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;PROTECTOR&quot;, 91,0,0,0,93, &quot;A Character must protect someone or something in this Turning Point. If this is an Action Plot Point, the Character must actively protect in this Turning Point from a threat. If it is a Personal Plot Point, then the Character receives the protection duty in this Turning Point.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CRESCENDO&quot;, 93,0,0,0,0, &quot;A series of events that has taken place in this Adventure culminates in this Turning Point. If this is early in the Adventure or in this Plotline, then instead the Adventure or Plotline gets off to a fiery start. For instance, Characters following clues to track a cult finally discover their lair, resulting in a mass battle. Or, a Plotline about retrieving a stolen gem begins with a very elaborate theft&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;DESTROY THE THING&quot;, 95,0,0,0,0, &quot;A Character must destroy or try to destroy something in this Turning Point. Maybe a party of dungeon delvers reaches the heart of the cavern where they must break a mystic seal.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;CONSPIRACY THEORY&quot;, 0,0,94,0,0, &quot;A Character believes in a scenario that explains a problem in this Adventure. The Character may be right or wrong, but the theory may cause action on the part of the Character. For instance, a group is holed up in a mall during a zombie apocalypse. One Character believes it’s just a disease, so they encourage the others not to shoot the zombies.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;SERVANT&quot;, 0,0,0,95,95, &quot;This Turning Point involves a servant or proxy of another Character. Invoke a Character for the servant to represent.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;AN OPPOSING STORY&quot;, 0,0,95,0,0, &quot;A Character learns of an alternate version of something they already know about from this Adventure. For instance, while investigating a starship that had been waylaid by aliens, Characters discover a crewmember who claims the attackers were members of a rival guild and not aliens.&quot; ],\n\t[ &quot;META&quot;, 100,100,100,100,100, &quot;This is a special Plot Point category with Plot Points that change the Characters List or combine Plotlines. Go to the Meta Plot Points Table and roll 1d100 on it for your Plot Point.&quot;, 2 ]\n]);\n__\nSets up this shortcut-file"},"support/inlineScripts/arrows.sfile":{"title":"arrows.sfile","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Shortcuts for writing various arrows:\n\n→←↑↓\n▶◀▲▼\n⇒⇐⇑⇓\n↔↕⇔⇕⇄⇅\n↗↘↖↙\n↪↩↻↺↝↜\n\n__\n^(?:arrow right|\\-\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;→&quot;;\n__\n→ - → (RIGHT arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow right\n__\n^(?:arrow left|\\&lt;\\-)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;←&quot;;\n__\n&lt;- - ← (LEFT arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow left\n__\n^(?:arrow up|\\-\\^)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↑&quot;;\n__\n-^ - ↑ (UP arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow up\n__\n^(?:arrow down|\\-v)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↓&quot;;\n__\n-v - ↓ (DOWN arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow down\n\n__\n^(?:tri right|\\|\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;▶&quot;;\n__\n|&gt; - ▶ (RIGHT triangle).\n- Alternative: tri right\n__\n^(?:tri left|\\&lt;\\|)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;◀&quot;;\n__\n&lt;| - ◀ (LEFT triangle).\n- Alternative: tri left\n__\n^(?:tri up|\\|\\^)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;▲&quot;;\n__\n|^ - ▲ (UP triangle).\n- Alternative: tri up\n__\n^(?:tri down|\\|v)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;▼&quot;;\n__\n|v - ▼ (DOWN triangle).\n- Alternative: tri down\n\n__\n^(?:arrow dbl right|\\=\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇒&quot;;\n__\n=&gt; - ⇒ (RIGHT double-arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow dbl right\n__\n^(?:arrow dbl left|\\&lt;\\=)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇐&quot;;\n__\n&lt;= - ⇐ (LEFT double-arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow dbl left\n__\n^(?:arrow dbl up|\\=\\^)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇑&quot;;\n__\n=^ - ⇑ (UP double-arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow dbl up\n__\n^(?:arrow dbl down|\\=v)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇓&quot;;\n__\n=v - ⇓ (DOWN double-arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow dbl down\n\n__\n^(?:arrow leftright|\\&lt;\\-\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↔&quot;;\n__\n&lt;→ - ↔ (LEFT / RIGHT arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow leftright\n__\n^(?:arrow updown|\\^\\-v)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↕&quot;;\n__\n^-v - ↕ (UP / DOWN arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow updown\n__\n^(?:arrow dbl leftright|\\&lt;\\=\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇔&quot;;\n__\n&lt;=&gt; - ⇔ (LEFT / RIGHT double arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow dbl leftright\n__\n^(?:arrow dbl updown|\\^\\=v)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇕&quot;;\n__\n^=v - ⇕ (UP / DOWN double arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow dbtl updown\n__\n^(?:arrow left right|\\&lt;\\/\\/\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇄&quot;;\n__\n&lt;//&gt; - ⇄ (LEFT arrow &amp; RIGHT arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow left right\n__\n^(?:arrow up down|\\^\\/\\/v)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;⇅&quot;;\n__\n^//v - ⇅ (UP arrow &amp; DOWN arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow up down\n\n__\n^(?:arrow rightup|\\-\\^\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↗&quot;;\n__\n-^&gt; - ↗ (RIGHT / UP arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow rightup\n__\n^(?:arrow rightdown|\\-v\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↘&quot;;\n__\n-v&gt; - ↘ (RIGHT / DOWN arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow rightdown\n__\n^(?:arrow leftup|\\&lt;\\^\\-)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↖&quot;;\n__\n&lt;^- - ↖ (LEFT / UP arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow leftup\n__\n^(?:arrow leftdown|\\&lt;v\\-)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↙&quot;;\n__\n&lt;v- - ↙ (LEFT / DOWN arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow leftdown\n\n__\n^(?:arrow curve right|u\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↪&quot;;\n__\nu&gt; - ↪ (RIGHT curve arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow curve right\n__\n^(?:arrow curve left|\\&lt;u)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↩&quot;;\n__\n&lt;u - ↩ (LEFT curve arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow curve left\n__\n^(?:arrow clock|c\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↻&quot;;\n__\nc&gt; - ↻ (CLOCKWISE arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow clock\n__\n^(?:arrow cclock|\\&lt;c)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↺&quot;;\n__\n&lt;c - ↺ (COUNTER-CLOCKWISE arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow cclock\n__\n^(?:arrow wavy right|\\~\\&gt;)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↝&quot;;\n__\n~&gt; - ↝ (RIGHT wavy arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow wavy right\n__\n^(?:arrow wavy left|\\&lt;\\~)$\n\n__\nreturn &quot;↜&quot;;\n__\n&lt;~ - ↜ (LEFT wavy arrow).\n- Alternative: arrow wavy left"},"support/inlineScripts/cards.sfile":{"title":"cards.sfile","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Shortcuts for working with virtual cards.\nThis shortcut-file has a tutorial video available:\nUsing the “cards” shortcut-file to use virtual cards (runtime 12:43)\nHere are some good card images you can download to try this out:\nPlaying cards - Standard playing cards.
